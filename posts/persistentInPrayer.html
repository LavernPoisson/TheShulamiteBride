                Luke 18:1-8 AMPC<br /><br />

                [1] ALSO [Jesus] told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not to turn coward
                (faint, lose heart, and give up).<br /><br />

                [2] He said, In a certain city there was a judge who neither reverenced nor feared God nor respected nor
                considered man.<br /><br />

                Now we know that God is our Judge!!!<br />
                in the courts of Heaven according to the jurisdiction order of Heaven...<br /><br />

                The characteristics of the judge mentioned in this parable tell me that this is not a godly person.
                When I think about what rules over some communities, I see corruption, violence, exploitation, drug
                addictions,<br /><br />

                gang wars, power, and control.<br />
                I believe that whatever rules or controls our communities are the powers ruling over them ... so
                whatever we see ruling our cities, that is the jurisdiction of that place, and this is what has been
                allowed by the community, especially when we don't pray for our cities and believe in God for a
                breakthrough. So what we allow will be allowed, and what we disallow will not be allowed or have any
                legal ground over us.<br /><br />


                [3] And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, "Protect and defend and give
                me justice against my adversary."<br /><br />

                A widow is someone that has lost her husband and lost a part of herself. She is someone who has lost
                great loss; she was

                use of having a companion and friend, and now that part is missing in her life.
                What are we losing in this life?<br /><br />

                Do you think that the widow could get to the judge physically, and yet the scripture says that she kept
                coming to him? Now I came. I can only imagine what she kept going to him for; this was over an
                adversary, something that was out to devour her. I am sure the state of the city could have been
                devouring her.<br /><br />

                [4] And for a time he would not, but later he said to himself, "Though I have neither reverence nor fear
                for God nor respect nor consideration for man,<br />
                [5] Yet because this widow continues to bother me, I will defend and protect and avenge her, lest she
                give me intolerable annoyance and wear me out by her

                continually coming or, at the last, she comes and rails on me or assaults me or strangles
                me.<br /><br />

                And for a time he did not help her; her persistence wore him out. I believe he was a ruthless man, as
                explained in scripture so the logical explanation is that she wore him out in prayer
                She kept going to our High Priest and Judge and Ruler in the heavenlies, and whilst corruption continued
                in the land, she persistently continued to go to enter her plea to the courts of heaven.
                And so heaven bombarded earth and gave the unjust judge no rest in His mind for the lawlessness and
                corruption in the land.<br /><br />

                You see, we are heaven's legislators. Bringing order to earth when we enter the courts of heaven and
                begin to intercede

                for our land.
                Sometimes we feel like our prayers are going unanswered...sometimes it feels long and painful... but
                what do you think is happening as you continue to gage in prayer

                Wears me out? How does the evil judge wear out?<br /><br />

                [6] Then the Lord said, Listen to what the unjust judge says!
                [7] And will not [our just] God defend and protect and avenge His elect (His chosen ones), who cry to
                Him day and night? Will He defer them and delay help on their behalf?<br /><br />

                Then the Lord said in this parable, Listen to what the unjust judge says... The one and only ruler over
                all things will hear us when we begin to cry out,

                Our prayers go to God like a sweet-smelling aroma; He hears and delivers, he softens the heart of
                others, He goes before us

                [8] I tell you, He will defend and protect and avenge them speedily. However, when the Son of Man comes,
                will He find faith on the earth?

                Now as we step into a time of prayer? Let us remember that it's okay to be persistent in prayer; the
                Bible says knock and keep knocking.<br /><br />

                Persistent people are those that don't give up!!!!<br />
                You don't give up" are those that love....<br /><br />

                Love for God..."dont give up."<br />
                Love for your family...""don't give up."<br />
                Love for your neighbors..."dont give up."<br />
                Love for community... "Don't give up."<br />
                Love for humanity..."dont give up."<br /><br />

                The effectual prayer of the righteous avails much<br /><br />

                John 14:15-17 NKJV<br />

                [15] “If you love Me, keep My commandments. [16] And I will pray the Father, and He will give you
                another Helper, that He may abide with you forever—[17] the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot
                receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be
                in you.<br /><br />

                The Helper is the "Holy Spirit."<br /><br />

                The Holy Spirit will teach you how to pray; you cannot receive the Holy Spirit without accepting Jesus
                as your personal savior.
                The world cannot receive the Holy Spirit.
                You must let go of your past life that is perishing and join yourself to His holiness and allow the Holy
                Spirit to teach you everything you need to know.<br /><br />

                Your family. Your community. are all depending on you to make the right choice!!!<br />
                Be persistent.<br /><br />
