                Romans 10:11-14 NKJV<br/>
                [11] For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.” [12] For there is no<br/>
                distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him.<br/><br/>

                For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”<br/><br/>

                Who is Whoever?<br/>
                Any person that will come in whatever situation you may find yourself in.
                Regardless of who you are. Despite the fact that you have fallen or feel any sense of feeling less of a
                person<br/>
                ...we all fall short,<br/>
                No matter what you might feel or think about yourself...God is talking to and addressing whoever... so
                if you feel like you are the whoever then I believe this message is for you...<br/><br/>

                We all feel like the who so ever, you see God doesn't call the qualified... He qualifies the called.<br/><br/>

                Who ever "believes" will not be put to shame....<br/><br/>

                Now I know that sometimes we have so many setbacks 1and blockages and things that are in the way,
                holding us back and making it impossible from getting where we need to be ... but if you could just hold
                on to your faith and believe. It must come to pass...<br/><br/>

                Luke 18:8 the question asked is that when God returns will He find faith?<br/><br/>

                So those who believe will not be put to shame... so if you have Faith like a mustard seed and if you
                have just a little inside of you that still believes that the re is a God, that He can do the
                impossible, that He can turn your situation around... then I believe that there is a promise from in
                this scripture that says if you believe then you will not be put to shame...<br/><br/>

                This is a promise that you can hold onto, this is a promise that you can remind God of, when you feel
                that you have been shamed in anyway... Does not the word of God say remind me ....<br/><br/>

                Isaiah 43:26 NKJV<br/>
                [26] Put Me in remembrance; Let us contend together; State your case, that you may be acquitted.<br/><br/>

                And so we see that we are able to remind God of his word, we can come bodly to the throne room of God
                and state our case, we have this freedom the the blood of Jesus, we have this freedom because when He
                was nailed to the cross of calvary<br/><br/>

                We have been given the freedom because the veil was torn, so now we can come body to the throne room and
                we can state our case to our God and Saviour...<br/><br/>

                [12] For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who
                call upon Him.<br/><br/>

                There is no distinction between you and I, there is no distinction between you and your neighbor, there
                is no difference between black and white, Indian and colored, Nigerian and Khoza...
                We are all loved by God, the only thing that separates us from the Father is sin.<br/><br/>

                "For the same Lord over all is just to all who call apon him."<br/><br/>

                Jehovah Jireh He is our provider<br/>
                Jehovah Nissi...My God of victory<br/>
                Jehovah Shalom... My prince of peace<br/><br/>

                Romans 10:14<br/>
                How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of
                whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?
                And so brethren I urge you, if you are called to preach...preach, dont be disappointed by the amount of
                numbers you may preach too because the one that you preach too may just be the one that will bring 1000
                to Christ...<br/><br/>

                But whatever you do, do it unto the Lord, the increase belongs to Him....<br/>
                How will they hear if you dont preach?<br/>
                Faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of the Lord.<br/><br/>

                You may be feeling like you are the who so ever,<br/>
                I have good news for you... You are Gods "who so ever" to bring hope and a future to a world of the who
                so ever...
                God uses the who so ever " God uses those that have nothing to brag or boast about, so that they can
                recognise His power and brag in Him...
                God is not done yet, His spirit is hovering over this world, He is looking and seeking for you, He is
                looking and seeking for a pure heart and clean heart...to carry out His perfect will...
                Don't judge yourself by appearance, dont judge yourself by past hurts.
                Don't judge yourself by your limited vision...
                Start seeing yourself as He sees you.."Strong and Courageous"
                Start reminding yourself of who you are and whose you are...<br/>
                Rise up Woman of God<br/>
                Rise up Man of Valour<br/>
                Rise up Children of the Most High.<br/><br/>
