                Is Freedom In Relationship<br /><br />

                2 Corinthians 3:17 AMPC<br />
                [17] Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (emancipation
                from
                bondage, freedom).<br /><br />

                I want to speak specifically to relationships between man and woman.<br />
                Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (The meaning of liberty is freedom)<br />
                When the Spirit of God is not in a relationship, you will notice red flags. <br /><br />

                What Freedom will not do:<br /><br />

                [ ] Freedom doesn't cause you to hide the relationship from others.<br />
                [ ] Freedom doesn't cause you to lie concerning the relationship.<br />
                [ ] Freedom doesn't cause you to doubt if what you're doing is right.<br />
                [ ] There shouldn't be a feeling of guilt or shame. <br />
                [ ] When you are not free to spend time with family that should be questioned, and yes I know the amount
                of
                time with others shouldn't take pre-eminence.<br />
                [ ] When you can't make decisions for yourself and agree with your partner, there is no freedom in
                that.<br />
                [ ] Freedom doesn't cause you to lose your identity and your purpose.<br /><br />

                 But God has come to give us life and life more abundantly. To experience life and life more abundantly,
                we
                need the Spirit of God, we need the Holy Spirit.<br />

                This is what a relationship should look like when the Spirit of God is in it, God wants you to Ask Him
                for
                guidance and support. <br /><br />

                [ ] The relationship grows at a steady pace. There is no stagnation in the Spirit of God.<br />
                [ ] You advance in the relationship in purpose, growth is evident in the relationship.<br />
                [ ] The relationship should move from meeting each other to friendship, with marriage as part of the
                plan.<br />
                [ ] Marriage shouldn't be its final destination, but it should advance others in their walk in their
                faith. <br />
                [ ] The relationship will begin to help others in whichever small or large way.<br /><br />

                There are stages in a relationship and where there is stagnation in a process these should be considered
                red
                flags.<br />
                Now I'm not saying that sometimes things are not delayed or that you shouldn't take things a bit slow,
                each
                person will relate differently to what I am saying, and you will know if you are feeling stagnated you
                will
                know...
                The Spirit of God lives on the inside of us, and He is all-knowing, so we are all-knowing as well
                because He
                lives within us.<br />
                Some signals indicate when things are wrong, but sometimes we choose to avoid those real realities, we
                sometimes don't want to face the truth, we sometimes choose to condescend, we don't trust that God can
                do it
                when He will do it, and we don't have the patience to wait on God.<br /><br />

                "But those who wait on God, He will renew your strength. He will mount up on wings like eagles, He will
                cause you to run and not become weary... "<br />
                Freedom causes you to run. Freedom will cause you to make the right choices.<br /><br />

                The Spirit of God causes you to make sound decisions and have freedom in those choices, The Spirit of
                God
                causes proper alignments in relationships these relationships understand the purpose. The Spirit of God
                will
                assure you when choosing your significant other.<br /><br />

                2024 is a year of divine relationship... Kingdom marriages like never before, God is preparing His
                people
                part of this preparation is letting go of those things that have been weighing you down. Those
                heavyweights
                that we have placed on ourselves due to a lack of faith in God. Those relationships that have worn you
                out,
                compromised in losing your identity through these wrong choices... these choices have had a major impact
                on
                who you are, and you have lost your identity... I'm here to tell you that it's not too late... God's
                Spirit
                wants to rest in you, God wants you to be liberated and set free with the right life partner, He has
                seen
                your pain of what it's been like walking in a relationship with another yet suffering a slow death of
                loneliness. Walking in pain whilst you're holding onto someone else's rib... the rib cage is sore from
                constant hurt and pain. <br /><br />

                "Now" the spirit is the Lord and where He is at there is freedom. Now can you commit your life to him,
                commit your relationship to Him. Ask Him to help you restore the marriage in Jesus' Name... Speak to The
                Spirit of the Living God, He knows how to repair this union. He is a relational God... He's the God that
                can
                fix it, replace it, remove it... Let Him do it and find freedom today... Find freedom once more... Find
                Freedom. He can do it Now because His Spirit is Now, and it is with you.<br /><br />
