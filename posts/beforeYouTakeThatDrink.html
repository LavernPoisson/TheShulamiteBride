                Proverbs 31:1-9 NKJV<br /><br />

                [1] The words of King Lemuel, the utterance which his mother taught him: [2] What, my son? And what, son
                of my womb? And what, son of my vows? [3] Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to that
                which destroys kings. [4] It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for
                princes intoxicating drink: [5] Lest they drink and forget the law, And pervert the justice of all the
                afflicted. [6] Give strong drink to him who is perishing, and wine to those who are bitter of heart. [7]
                Let him drink and forget his powered remember his misery no more. [8] Open your mouth for the
                speechless, In the cause of all who are appointed to die. [9] Open your mouth, judge righteously, and
                plead the cause of the poor and needy.<br />
                (5) And pervert the justice of all the afflicted.
                What happens when we drink wine?<br /><br />

                We get drunk, we become irrational, we compromise our standard, we become lawless, we speak ill of
                others because we think we know better than others.<br /><br />

                [6] Give strong drink to him who is perishing, and wine to those who are bitter of heart.<br /><br />

                Ask yourself this question? Are you perishing, are things so bad are you digging in the bin for
                scraps...Are you bitter, bitterness speaks to hatred in the heart... carrying around bitterness hatred
                and anger toward others...<br /><br />

                [7] Let him drink and forget his poverty remember his misery no more.<br /><br />

                So, we see that alcohol is for miserable people, people that are in poverty, it' for those to block out
                the misery of their life.
                So now we know why most people forget the problems, alcohol makes you forget.<br /><br />

                (8) Open your mouth for the speechless, In the cause of all who are appointed to die.<br /><br />

                So, what does a king do? A king has been given authority over land to speak a decree and let it be
                established, a king has been given a position of royalty to influence the spheres of influence...to
                dominate and to set people free....<br />
                Open your mouth for the speechless.... but if you don't know who you are and what is placed within you,
                then you will continue to walk around like the oppressed and never step out into your kingly anointing<br /><br />

                (9) Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.<br /><br />

                Can a drunk person judge righteously or plead the cause of the poor and needy?<br /><br />

                So today I ask you, Are you a King? And if that answer is yes, then my next question is why are behaving
                like a scavenger digging in the dirt for scraps?<br />
                Your place is seated on the right-hand side of the Father, you have a kingly position, know who you are
                take your place rise up and be the King.<br /><br />
