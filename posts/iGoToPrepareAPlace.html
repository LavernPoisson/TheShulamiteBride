                John 14:2 NKJV<br />
                In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare
                a place for you.<br /><br />

                In my father's house; let us define my father's house:<br />
                A dwelling place, place of residence<br />
                A place to abide in, a house is a place where you live.<br /><br />

                "I go to prepare a place."<br /><br />

                John 17:9<br />
                Jesus prays for us, for those of us that have been given to Him by the Father.<br />
                Jesus is making intercession on behalf of us...preparing a place for us.<br /><br />

                He walked the face of the earth as a human; He experienced everything that we
                go through, He knows the battles we are faced with daily.
                He knows how to intercede on behalf of us, having lived just like us on earth.<br /><br />

                Hebrews 7:25 NKJV<br /><br />
                Therefore, He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always
                lives to make intercession for them.<br /><br />

                Other versions in the Bible say, "In my father's house are many rooms."<br />
                In different areas of rooms we find different items depending on what the room will be used for; a room
                we sleep in has furniture, clothing, a bed to sleep in, personal belongings...<br /><br />

                A room is also a place of intimacy, a place of rest, a place to unwind, and a place to
                reflect.<br /><br />

                A room is a personal space and a safe haven.<br /><br />

                There are many of these rooms; I am sure that each room has it own unique look about it.<br />
                "In my father's house there are many rooms, many treasures," many mansions. "A mansion is extremely
                massive,<br />
                In my father's house, there is freedom.<br />
                in my father's house there is expansion and growth.<br />
                In my father's house I am liberated and set free; I am in awe of His greatness.<br />
                In my father's house, I receive provision; my father is my provider. My healer, my comforter, I can be
                intimate with Him.<br />
                I can speak to Him freely; there are no barriers or chains preventing us from connecting.
                The scripture says that there are many<br /><br />

                mansions/rooms.<br /><br />

                And so when we get into that intimate place with Christ, we unlock hidden treasures.<br /><br />

                "I will give you the hidden treasures in secret places...Isaiah 45:3"<br /><br />

                Long life, prosperity, wisdom, guidance in relationships and work to get you out from where you are,
                health, knowledge of the depth of God,
                Foresight to know things to come, discernment, and direction—these are the hidden treasures.<br /><br />

                A room is also a place of privacy, a secret place.
                There is a place in Christ a place that is so hidden, where not even the enemy can touch
                you,<br /><br />

                Psalms 91:1 NKJV<br />
                He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the
                Almighty.<br /><br />

                Like I mentioned earlier, in my father's house is a dwelling place.<br /><br />

                The secret place is also a place of protection, a place where the spirit of God dwells; in this place
                the enemy has no power because you are abiding in God.<br /><br />

                2 Timothy 2:20-21 AMP<br /><br />
                Now in a large house there are not only vessels and objects of gold and silver, but also vessels and
                objects of wood and of earthenware, and some are for honorable (noble, good) use and some for
                dishonorable (ignoble, common). Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things [which are
                dishonorable—disobedient, sinful], he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified [set apart for a special
                purpose], and useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.<br /><br />

                Here we see a passage making reference to a house, and the items in the house are you and I.<br />
                There are items that can be used and other items that are discarded...in waking life, there are people
                that are willing to be used by God and others that are not.<br /><br />

                And so the question remains, do we want to be used by God? do we want to be gold or silver... to become
                a vessel of gold and silver requires a whole lot of refining; gold and silver go through an immense
                process.

                of purification in the fires.
                The more expensive and valued, the higher the heat and the longer the process...
                There are wooden materials and earthenware, and yes, some wooden containers can be used to be filled
                with oil, and some earthenware can be used for the purposes of God, yet these materials have their
                expiry date, and in fires they will warp and burn out....
                Some run from the fires because they become too much, but he who endures till the end will be
                saved.<br /><br />

                John 14:3-4 NKJV<br />
                And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am,
                there you may be also.<br />
                [4] And where I go, you know, and the way you know.”<br /><br />

                Jesus is the only way, the truth, and the life; whoever comes to the Father comes through His son Jesus,
                and so to know the only true way, you must be born again; you must accept Jesus as your personal savior.
                Jesus has left the Holy Spirit with us whilst He is preparing our eternity.,
                The Holy Spirit guides us, teaches us, and helps us on this walk; He helps us find our way to
                Jesus.<br /><br />

                John 14:6 NKJV<br />
                Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.

                To get to the Father, You must go through Jesus; He is the only way...

                John 14:1<br />

                [1] “Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.<br /><br />

                We all believe in God...hence Jesus is saying here, "Believe also in Me."
                To be truly born again, you must receive. Jesus as your personal Lord and savior and receive the Holy
                Spirit.
                God the Father, God the Son. God the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />

                The place is prepared for you and me; there is an eternity, heaven is real; you will only experience it
                through Jesus.<br /><br />
