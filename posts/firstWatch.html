                6pm to 9pm:<br /><br />
                Prayers of repentance, laying foundations in
                prayer,
                repentance for self, for the Body of Christ, for our Nation.<br /><br />

                Prayer Decrees for the First Prayer Watch
                I am God’s child by faith in Christ Jesus,
                I renew my covenant commitment to love Him with all my heart, soul and strength. Through Jesus Christ,
                I am Abraham’s descendant, and an inheritor of the covenant blessings God promised to Abraham
                (Galatians 3:26, 27, 29).<br /><br />

                Lord, you have placed your laws in my mind and have written them in my heart. (Hebrews 8:10, 12).<br />

                Keep me steadfast in you, you uphold me in your hands, everything has been made for your glory, to
                worship you.<br /><br />

                Lamentations 2:19 NKJV
                “Arise, cry out in the night, At the beginning of the watches; Pour out your heart like water before the
                face of the Lord.
                Lift your hands toward Him For the life of your young children, who faint from hunger at the head of
                every street.”<br /><br />

                I pray for repentance for the church, leaders, elders, government authorities, legal authorities that
                govern the land.
                I repent on behalf of myself, my loved ones, my community, the nations, my country and all within it....
                I repent on behalf of my fore father's,
                for words that have been spoken
                I bring them each to your throne,
                Father has mercy, remember us, remember us this day have mercy on us.
                I cry out to you o Lord, I lift up my hands in full surrender, I remember our youth and lift them up to
                you, forgive our ignorance o Lord, forgive our wickedness that only sees vanity, forgive our
                youth...preserve their life, spare our children Lord.<br /><br />

                Forgive all our iniquities and forgive us all our transgressions. Deliver us from the evil one, forgive
                our wickedness and never again remember our sins.      <br /><br />

                It is written that "If we confess our sins, Lord, you are faithful and just and will forgive us our sins
                and purify us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9.<br /><br />

                A prayer of repentance for the nations "Nehemiah"<br /><br />

                The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah:
                In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, 2 Hanani, one of my
                brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had
                survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.
                3 They said to me, “Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and
                disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.”
                4 When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before
                the God of heaven. 5 Then I said:
                “Lord, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love
                him and keep his commandments, 6 let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your
                servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins
                we Israelites, including myself and my father’s family, have committed against you. 7 We have acted very
                wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.
                8 “Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will
                scatter you among the nations, 9 but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled
                people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have
                chosen as a dwelling for my Name.’
                10 “They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty
                hand. 11 Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your
                servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the
                presence of this man.”<br /><br />

                We thank you that we have access, to reign and rule and become one with you, we thank you for fellowship
                with the Holy Spirit. We thank you for always making ways for us to enter into relationship with you.
                Thank you for the written word, thank you for sending Your Son to the cross of calvary for the
                redemption of our sins.<br /><br />

                God’s words are what sustain me; they are food to my hungry soul. And, Your Word brings joy to my heart,
                because I have hidden it in my heart so that I might not sin against you.
                (Jeremiah 15:16; Psalm 119:11)<br /><br />

                I thank you gracious Lord for your mercy<br />
                I thank you for your grace, I thank you for your loving kindness, I thank you for your faithfulness that
                You hear and to heal our land.<br /><br />
