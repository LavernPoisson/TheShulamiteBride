                Genesis 6:1-3, 8-9 NKjV<br /><br />

                [1] Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to
                them, [2] that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives
                for themselves of all whom they chose.<br /><br />

                This passage of scripture speaks about the fallen angels; "the sons of God" are the fallen angels
                And so they took wives for themselves, when they consummated, and wives gave birth, the children born
                into this world were not 100% human and if the DNA of the human race was corrupted, then for God to
                allow that dispensation of people in that time would have corrupted the original.

                plan of God.<br /><br />

                We have come full circle to this very time again. "Living In the days of Noah," now we are living
                through a moment; we living in the AI, and the enemy is trying to corrupt our DNA once
                again.<br /><br />

                [3] And the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his
                days
                shall be one hundred and twenty years.”<br /><br />

                Genesis 6:5
                [5] Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the
                thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.<br /><br />

                So we are living in a time that is just like Noah's.<br /><br />

                We are faced with wickedness; the fear of God is no longer found amongst many...
                Each man is for themselves, lawlessness,
                Is rife,
                Man's heart has grown cold; there is nothing to keep the fires burning.
                People have become accustomed to living anyhow, partying, drugs, sharing partners, and so forth, all
                acts of debauchery.
                We are faced with our DNA being altered. The enemy has always been after the human race because of what
                we carry, because God has created us in His very own image, and because we are higher than the angels.
                We are a threat to the ones that have fallen; we are a threat to the devoured and his
                agents.<br /><br />

                This is not to stereotype; there are a remnant of people... God's people... that dont fit this category.
                These people are committed.

                to staying the course of life no matter the outcome. These ones have had an encounter with the Eternal
                God, and these ones are willing to fight for humanity.

                [8] But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. [9] This is the genealogy of Noah. Noah was a just
                man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God.<br /><br />

                But Noah found grace.... And so God had given Noah the task to build the ark,...... before being called
                to the ark,
                He was likely a farmer and carpenter.
                We are living in a time like this; simple men, such as Noah, are being called to the forefront to build
                the ark of the Lord.<br /><br />

                Genesis 6:9 says that Noah was blameless in his generation and an upright man.<br />
                Are there any blameless men and women?<br /><br />

                that will answer to the call of God and will begin to build according to the way God would have them
                build. According to the blueprint and pattern of God.<br /><br />

                Genesis 2:5-6:<br />
                "The LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. But
                there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground." 

                Lack of Mention according to google
                Rain is absent from the biblical narrative until God's instruction to Noah about the coming flood,
                indicating a significant change in the Earth's water cycle occurred with the Flood itself. <br /><br />

                Can you imagine? Rain was never mentioned before.<br /><br />

                Noah had, by faith, trusted and believed God for what was to come. Furthermore, can you imagine having
                to explain to his neighbors, his family, and his associates that there was this rain that would come and
                wash the entire earth out? No one believed except his own family.<br /><br />

                This is consoling, especially to those in ministry. Not everyone will get your revelation; not everyone
                will hear when God speaks to you, woman of God, man of God, except those that are close to you and close
                to your ministry.
                Dont let that stop you from building; God has placed it in you.
                You don't need followers; Noah didn't have any beside his wife and kids.<br /><br />

                Now we see that the reason God had not caused it to rain was because there was no one to till the
                ground.<br /><br />

                And so if God caused it to rain, the earth would lie in ruins because man was all for self, seeking
                their own desires. The rain would have caused damage, and so God still protected His people; He still
                gave them time to repent.
                The wickedness was great, so what was given to man? They did not even see the beauty of the earth. No
                wonder there was no one to till the land; it's because they were too attracted to their own doings,
                gratifying their own flesh... to till the land means to look after it.
                To take authority, to have dominion, but none could take authority or have dominion because they were
                controlled by the lusts of the flesh. Remember that the DNA of humans was altered as well.<br /><br />

                God used mist to clean and purify the lands; mist is condensed water, much, much softer and gentler when
                it was released to cleanse the earth.<br /><br />

                Genesis 6:14<br />
                Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and outside with pitch.
                [15] And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width
                fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. [16] You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall
                finish it to a cubit from above, and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it with lower,
                second, and third decks.<br /><br />

                This passage of scripture speaks to the specifications of God's design, the way the ark needs to be
                built, and, like I said earlier, we are living in the time of Noah 2.0.<br /><br />

                God is giving us the dimensions and the way we ought to build....<br />
                Are we listening to how we are building today?<br />
                What are we building?<br />
                What we build today is sure to have an impact in the future....<br />
                Are we building according to the design of God...?<br />
                How would we know if we are building according to God...?<br />

                Noah was righteous... "meaning in right standing with God... to be in right standing with God means
                that<br />
                He spoke to God,<br />
                that He walked with God,<br />
                that he acquired of God for His life....<br /><br />

                There are many Noahs today that are truly building.<br /><br />

                Genesis 7:1 NKJV<br /><br />

                [1] Then the Lord said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that
                you are righteous before Me in this generation.

                To encourage the person that is trusting in God for household salvation, "As for me and my household, we
                will serve the Lord...

                The Lord gave the instruction, "Come into the Ark, Noah, you and your household." You will never outdo
                God. You, Noah, were obedient in building the Ark, and God made sure to protect him and his entire
                family. This is the God we serve... He preserves our entire lineage; He preserved our entire
                generation...so we can never outdo God no matter what.

                Interestingly, we see in the previous passage in chapter 6 verse 8, Noah found grace.
                what I love about the word of God and His love for humanity,
                God is not just concerned about one person.
                Through Noah's obedience and right standing with God, his entire family came under this protection...

                Don't give up on that wayward son or daughter; don't give up on that mother or father.
                It is your right standing with God that will cause your entire family to come to the Lord.<br /><br />

                Genesis 7:15-16 NKJV<br />

                [15] And they went into the ark to Noah,

                two by two, of all flesh in which is the breath of life.

                God's heart was turned away from the world because of the wickedness.
                It may have seemed at the time that God is unjust, or what kind of God would destroy an entire planet
                with all His people? The people that died in that flood were not human; they were made by sons of God,
                and they were a mixture of human and angel.
                If God wanted a mixture in our DNA, we would have been created, and our DNA would be fragmented and
                diluted, making the essence of humanity, the very reason for life, ineffective.
                The dominion and power that is given to us would now be giving glory to Satan and his demons.
                If God didn't destroy the earth back then, evil itself would have destroyed it either way.<br /><br />


                He destroyed Earth to protect humanity.
                He flooded the entire earth and yet in His pain and anguish,
                He remembered Noah. He remembered the creation that He knit together. He will remember you. He will
                remember me.<br /><br />

                We were given another chance, and are given many chances to make right before the Lord, but we choose to
                continue in our acts.<br /><br />

                Genesis 7:20 NKJV<br /><br />

                [20] The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.

                [15] cubits is equivalent to 50 000 meters....

                [16] So those that entered, male and female

                of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the Lord shut him in.

                Male and female, I believe in this time God is raising up male and female "kingdom couples." These
                kingdom assignments are going to be used mightily to show the order of heaven on earth, to show how
                marriage is an illustration of God and His bride, the church...
                It was God that shut them in; God shut them in. God's hand is on you and on your partner
                God has shut you in, to preserve you for a plan and a specific function<br /><br />

                Yes, the two by two that entered the ark in the time of Noah were the animals for the sake of
                recreation.
                For the sake of the Kingdom of God, heaven on earth, for the purpose of Gods<br /><br />

                will to continue Kingdom couples are being ready to be used mightily.<br /><br />

                The word of God says two is better than one; when one falls, there will be another to pick him up.

                These kingdom couples are mandated to carry out a special task in building the Ark once more. The Ark
                will be a place for refugees that are lost, orphaned, and abandoned people that need a touch from God
                once more. These couples will be equipped with the patience, forbearance, and love of the Father...
                there won't be any of their own agenda; they are entering into the Ark for preparation.

                Genesis 8:20-22 NKJV<br /><br />

                [20] Then Noah built an altar to the Lord.<br /><br />

                and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

                When we see what the Lord has done and how far He has brought us... remember to build an altar of
                prayer, remember to build an altar of praise... remember the Lord; He remembered you when you were shut
                in the Ark, when you were protected from the elements of the world.

                [21] And the Lord smelled a soothing aroma.<br />
                Then the Lord said in His heart, “I will never again curse the ground for man’s sake, although the
                imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have
                done.<br /><br />

                Our prayers offered in praise and

                Thanksgiving goes to the heavens as a sweet-smelling aroma. Refer Revelations 5:8 and 8:4
                It was only after the sweet smell offered as a sacrifice to the Lord that He said He would never hurt
                the earth with water again, despite the fact that He knows our heart. He knows our hearts are wicked,
                but yet because of this selfless offer of an offering, the Lord changes His mind.
                I honestly do believe that God's heart can be changed by a person that has integrity and is true and in
                right standing with God.

                [22] “While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, winter and summer, and day and night
                shall not cease.”<br /><br />

                During the seed time, we prepare, we sow to the Spirit of God in prayers and

                sacrifices, however the Spirit of God leads us.
                We are called to build a new ark, one that's according to God's blueprint, according to heaven; as it is
                in heaven, so shall it be on earth. The function of the Unity being displayed on earth, Harvest time,
                remains so long as we have Christ within us; we are builders of an eternal, incorruptible, firm
                foundation that will never be shaken.<br /><br />

                God is in covenant with you and me; His word has spoken it....<br /><br />

                Genesis 6:18-19 NKJV<br />
                But I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall go into the ark<br /><br />

                Psalms 25:14 NKJV<br />
                The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him, And He will show them his covenant.<br /><br />
