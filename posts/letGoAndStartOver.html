        <section class="text-body">
            <p class="post-text"> It has never been easy letting go, especially when you can't see what waits on the
                other side.<br /><br />

                'Everything in life requires faith.'<br /><br />

                I remember a time when I held on so tight to that relationship.<br />
                It wasn't ordained by God, "none of them were."<br />
                When I look back I realise that if I held on, <br />
                I would've denied him the opportunity of finding himself, <br />
                I would've denied him a chance at true happiness.<br />

                'Being true to oneself requires acts of selflessness.'<br />

                I would've denied myself the opportunity of learning who I am,<br />
                'the real me,'<br />
                I had to learn that it's okay to be single.
                Self-discovery is important, I began to learn what I enjoyed most, what I was most passionate about. I
                didn't know that I was passionate about writing or teaching, gifts unlocked on the inside of me that I
                did
                not know I had because I was always in the shadow of a man.
                I would have never learnt this part of me if I stayed.<br /><br />

                I would've denied myself everything that God placed inside of me.<br /><br />

                Don't hold onto someone who does not belong to you, you will hurt yourself. <br />
                It's painful to walk around in a small pair of shoes 'Why do it?'
                That shoe doesn't fit anymore, The reason you outgrew the shoe in the first place is because it was
                never
                meant to fit.
                What is for you will fit perfectly.<br />
                God has His best waiting for you if only you believe.<br />
                There are too many broken women walking around holding onto men who were never created for them.<br />
                You can jump off a ceiling, roll over a thousand times, play cart wheels but if his not for you, He will
                never be yours...perhaps for a moment 'Yes' or he will be yours and everybody else.<br /><br />

                There is a perfect will and in God's perfect will a suitable help meet will come and add value to
                you.<br />
                His abilities and your abilities together will cause an explosion.<br />
                Two like-minded people coming together give way for dominion to be established. The kingdom of God is a
                place of addition and multiplication.<br /><br />

                When a relationship brings discord, division, and ugliness.<br />
                When you feel empty most of the time, when you constantly wonder where He might be or trust is a
                constant
                battle.<br />
                When there is no proper directive in the relationship vision is distorted. When you can't even support
                his
                hustle or are unable to hold up your partner's vision,
                Perhaps it's time to do a real heart-to-heart check to see and whey the pros and cons.<br /><br />

                God has not intended for our emotions to be on a roller coaster, neither did He intend for us to be
                insecure, unsure, or frustrated. <br /><br />

                He wants to perfect everything that concerns us, God is a relational God.<br />
                I know without a shadow of a doubt that He will perfect your relationship and work it out for your good.
                <br /><br />

                'It's okay to start over, this time you be starting from experience.'<br /><br />
