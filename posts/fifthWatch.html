                Prayer Decrees for This Watch
                Heavenly Father…
                Today I entrust my work to You; and I know my plans will succeed. (Proverbs 16:3).<br /><br />

                I can do everything You ask me to with the help of Christ who gives me the strength and power, in Jesus’
                Name. (Philippians 4:13)
                Because I reverence Your Name, Your goodness shines on me like the sun with healing in its rays.
                (Malachi 4:2)<br /><br />

                I praise You and never forget how kind You are to me! You forgive all my sins and heal all my
                sicknesses. Father, You save me from the grave and surround me with loving-kindness and tender mercies.
                (Psalm 103:2- 4)<br /><br />

                I release the healing virtue of Jesus Christ into my body. And I curse, at the root, every attack upon
                my health.
                Jehovah-Rophe heals me and keeps me in perfect health all the days of my life. 
                I plead the Blood of Jesus against all calamities, catastrophes and any hidden dangers that would try to
                come against me.
                Through the Blood of Jesus, I have been redeemed out of the hands of the devil.
                My life is not my own. Therefore, I dedicate my body to You as a living sacrifice—holy and well-pleasing
                to You. (Romans 12:1)<br /><br />

                Now begin to declare the same prayers the same healing prayers over loved ones that come to mind, over
                families and friends as the Spirit of God leads in prayer....<br /><br />

                I release the healing virtue of Jesus Christ into ...... And I curse, at the root, every attack upon
                ......... health.
                Jehovah-Rophe heals ........and keeps ...... in perfect health all the days of his/her life. 
                I plead the Blood of Jesus against all calamities, catastrophes and any hidden dangers that would try to
                come against ........
                Through the Blood of Jesus, .......has been redeemed out of the hands of the devil.
                His/her life is not their own.
                Therefore, I dedicate their body to You as a living sacrifice—holy and well-pleasing to You. (Romans
                12:1)<br /><br />

                Command every spirit of infirmity to be loosed in the name of Jesus
                Declare God's healing power and deliverance be set free in Jesus Mighty Name....
                But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our
                peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)<br /><br />

                I declare that healing comes to our land this day
                By every stripe that was taken by Jesus for the deliverance and healing of His people,

                His understanding and wisdom to direct and keep us on the path prepared for us.

                Christ....<br /><br />

                The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, for then the
