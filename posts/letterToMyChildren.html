        <section class="text-body">
            <p class="post-text">
                I am sorry for not knowing the difference between right and wrong. Before coming to Christ, I had no
                idea that jumping from boyfriend to boyfriend was wrong...<br />
                I was controlled by my own selfish lusts of this world and the pleasures of this world
                To my defense, "Hurt people hurt people."<br />
                As I was broken, hurt, and looking for love in all the wrong places, I didn't realize how I was hurting
                you in the process.<br /><br />

                The Bible speaks of self-control; I wouldn't have known had God not given me a chance. God is a God of a
                second chance... my prayer is that we all get a second chance with each other.<br /><br />

                I wish I had friends and family to tell me that I was selfish, inconsiderate, stupid, foolish... "The
                friends we keep are important; they depict the outcome of life." Show me your friends, and I'll show you
                your future.<br /><br />

                I probably did have family and friends that tried to speak to me; I guess when consumed with "SELF," you
                only listen to your own thoughts and believe that you are the smartest of them all...and in your sin,
                you are made to believe that what you are doing is right...<br /><br />

                It is sugar-coated, for example:
                "At least I'm not selling myself, atleast I don't drink every everyday, atleast I have a job."
                atleast...atleast...atleast, but we were never called to be atleast."
                We are called to be the best version of ourselves, the way that God created us to be...in His true
                image...<br /><br />

                I was the most stupid; now when I look back at my life,<br />
                I was taught not to look back; the word of God speaks about Lot's wife. When she looked back, she turned
                into a pillar of salt...<br />
                But now I know I am not looking back because of any desires of this world in my heart... when I look
                back I am reminded of my mess, and I pray and wish the best for you....
                My prayers and wishes for you are that God surround you all with loving, Godly people that will draw out
                the best in you."<br />
                The real you, not an imitation version of what you might think you are."
                My prayers are that your ears and eyes will be open to godly instruction.
                I didn't hear, nor did I see, in those moments, and it cost me everything.
                Everything for me is "you." Perhaps I haven't said it before, but now I see it.<br /><br />

                I am sorry for the life I chose and how I mismanaged each of you... not realizing that God saw it fit
                for Him to bless you with me.
                I didn't know that God made my womb fruitful and that I was blessed by each of you...
                He placed greatness inside of me when He gave me you... I carried the greatness of each of you, and
                greatness lives with each of you. Don't let anybody ever speak otherwise or make you see yourself as
                less, and if ever you feel drained out of a relationship, walk away and know that God did not order it.
                I heard the truth. I didn't really know the truth because I didn't know who God was...
                I wish I knew the depth of greatness that I carried immediately; perhaps I wouldn't have been careless
                with you and who I allowed into our lives.<br /><br />

                I thought that because I didn't abort any of you and because I made it my duty to provide for you, I did
                everything as a single mother.<br />
                I suppose I knew the importance of providing, but I was never there for you emotionally.
                I didnt even know how to be there for you.<br />
                I wasnt even there for myself emotionally.<br />
                I honestly didn't know how to be there. There are some things that can only be taught by the wisdom of
                God. If only I knew then the things I know now.<br /><br />

                I can't blame my upbringing or my parents; they tried to raise me with limited knowledge, being both
                teenagers as well... So everything spiralled into a cocoon of a mess.<br />
                I still couldn't blame them; they tried with what they had. So I am asking you, please don't blame me,
                as I too grew up with limited knowledge...<br /><br />

                I was never there for most of you growing into the young ladies and gents that you are... I worked most
                of my life; I've been working from the age of 16 years making provision " how limited my vision was I
                was providing things that are perishable, the spoils of this life..<br />
                Nothing solid, nothing substantial enough to carry yl through life,<br />
                So please, when God sends you all partners, make sure that you will have a helpmate, not a hit-and-run
                specialist.<br />
                So that you won't carry the burden alone as I have... make sure you have similar dreams and desires so
                that you can advance further... not carry a load, neglecting everything else as I had.<br /><br />

                I am sorry for the bad decisions I made that exposed you all to the elements of this world; living in a
                wicked place, people smile with you and dig graves with the same smile...
                But if I don't guard my heart and keep my heart from turning to stone, surely I will die...
                So I continue to turn a blind eye for peace's sake and continue to give people the benefit of the doubt.
                Call me stupid. "God has taught me that love covers a multitude of sin, and for those reasons I could
                never dismiss anyone...<br />
                I have learnt that the soul is all that God wants, and so I will continue to pray for the soul... let
                not our souls go to God fragmented; it takes longer to understand who God truly is with a fragmented
                soul." My soul was fragmented; don't enter into too many relations...it kills the soul.<br /><br />

                "Keziah, you are the smallest. One day I will explain, or your siblings will explain, this letter to
                you. I dont expect you to understand it now."<br /><br />

                My decisions have plagued me and have limited my ability to grow in everyday waking life.
                I trusted everyone to much "still do actually" and this too
                cost me.<br /><br />

                I didn't realize that I needed to express this pain I've been carrying, because I felt that once I gave
                my heart to the Lord, everything around me would begin to flourish, and yes, for a large part, it has
                flourished.<br />
                But my heart still bleeds because despite all the mistakes that I made, I genuinely love each of you
                more than words can explain. I feel it fitting to apologize before it's too late. Life is but a vapor,
                and whilst I trust God for many more prosperous years to come, I am also mindful that it is only God
                that holds the keys to life and death.<br /><br />

                And yet, I might have healed, yet I have left 6 of you to grow up to protect yourselves and fend for
                yourselves because of my careless life. It is said it's not how we start that counts, so I'm hoping that
                we can all be given a fresh start and a new perspective on life.<br /><br />

                I have prayed so hard that each of you should become everything that God created you to become.
                I asked God never to make any of you go through anything that was created by my foolishness... I have
                asked God to wipe our generation clean; your kids and my grandkids can eat the fruit of our labor and
                will not be sons of disobedience.<br /><br />

                I know that every sin has been thrown in the sea of forgetfulness, that I cant go back to change the
                past
                I know that God is able to help me change the course of the future for my family.<br /><br />

                One day in prayer the Lord showed me a vision of Alexis as a young woman; she was at least 22. In this
                vision I saw that she had need of something, and immediately the Lord drew my position to myself in
                prayer, and He said, "Because of your faithfulness, your family will never suffer lack. What Alexis had
                needed was what was provided for."<br /><br />

                I feel it necessary to take accountability for all the wrong I've done, realize what I have done, and
                ask for forgiveness from each of you.
                I need the healing power of God to restore the brokenness that I created so that His loving power can be
                free to move again.
                Please forgive me for every wrong thing.
                Please forgive me so that we can all be free to move forward.
                I have seen bitterness and unforgiveness cause much damage; it has brought pain and sickness.
                This life is full of wickedness, and if we don't pull together with all our inadequacies and be there
                for each other, then who will be there for us? A house divided against itself cannot stand.<br /><br />

                Never neglect God or His presence.<br />
                Kids should honor their parents no matter what they are; parents should never grieve their kids...
                "Please forgive me for grieving you." Make time for each other, don't grow apart, and learn to be part
                of each other... God has connected you all through me.<br /><br />

                I John 4:18 NKJV<br />
                18] There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who
                fears has not been made perfect in love.<br />
                I know as a family we have suffered much pain, much separation, much affliction. But God wants us to
                heal from every trauma; there is no fear when God is in us because He is Love... So in order for us to
                be made perfect in love, we must get rid of fear.<br /><br />

                And love again, because God has given us a second chance.<br /><br />

                "Kelly, God has seen it fit for you to deliver this message to your siblings. I am grateful to God that
                I have the chance I prayed for with you. God has answered my prayers where you have been concerned. I
                trust and believe that God will do it again with your siblings.<br /><br />

                I am sharing this message on my blog. It is not for any self-gratification but rather to help parents
                like myself, so journey on. We all learn from each other's experiences, and we all need to help each
                other grow.<br />
                These are the mysteries of the Kingdom of God.
                Be selfless and courageous; show that it's okay to be flawed and it's okay to apologize.
                Mean what you say, and do what you mean.<br />
                My prayer is for this letter to heal not only my kids but also to reach others that need healing
                too.<br /><br />
