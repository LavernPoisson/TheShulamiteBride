                3pm to 6pm: <br /><br />

                The eighth is the last, final watch of the night, a time for prayer for revival and renewal.
                Why? We rejoice because of the power of the cross. Symbolically, Christ willingly became a sin offering
                and died at 3 pm.<br />
                We thank God that He conquered the power of the grave!<br /><br />

                In this prayer watch, we receive power through the cross, the manifest presence of the sacrifice that
                was made.
                A total immersing in His presence and becoming one with the Father<br /><br />

                Prayer Decrees for This Watch<br /><br />

                Heavenly Father…
                I have been crucified with Christ; and I myself no longer live, but Christ lives in me.
                The life I know I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. (Galatians
                2:20)<br /><br />

                I give myself completely to you.
                I am a tool, in Your hands, to be used for Your good purposes.
                You have created me, in Christ Jesus, to live a life filled with good works that You have enabled me to
                do by the power of Your Holy Spirit.
                (Ephesians 2:10)<br /><br />

                The good work You began in me will continue until you complete it on the day when Jesus Christ comes
                again. (Philippians 1:6)<br /><br />

                I am grateful that You always lead me in victory through Christ. And through me, you spread the
                knowledge of Christ everywhere like perfume.
                (2 Corinthians 2:14)<br /><br />

                On the night before Jesus died, He prayed that His people would be one.
                John 17: 18-23<br /><br />

                “As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them, I sanctify myself, that they
                too may be truly sanctified.
                “My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,
                that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.
                May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory
                that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one
                I in them and you in me–so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you
                sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.”<br /><br />

                Genesis 3:8-10 NKJV<br />
                [8] And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and
                his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. [9] Then the
                Lord God called to Adam and said to him, “Where are you?” [10] So he said, “I heard Your voice in the
                garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.”
                O Father, let us, your people, the body of Christ... May we never hide from you
                Teach us to obey, teach us to love, teach us once more...May we never become so puffed up with your word
                that we have unteachable spirits....<br />
                May we never become afraid to enter into your presence....<br />
                May sin never be the cause that separates us from your presence
                may we run to you and not away from you....<br />
                Fall fresh on your people o Lord, fall fresh on us, cause us to become sensitive enough to hear when you
                are drawing us to that place of fellowship with you,
                We declare a spiritual awakening in the Body of Christ,
                We declare open our ears to hear you and open our eyes to see as you see,
                we declare that all of our senses are open.
                Inscribe the word in our hearts and sanctify our minds for your purpose for your glory.<br /><br />

                We pray for the body of Christ to align itself...<br />
                Pray against the spirit of busyness,
                Pray for discernment to know the times, help us when we are persecuted, help us to truly assess the
                times we are living in, teach us that we wrestle against not flesh but rulers and principalities in high
                places.<br /><br />

                Give us discernment to know when God is walking in the cool of the day, when God is looking for
                fellowship
                Help us to enter into Your presence in the cool of the day...
                There is freedom in your presence,
                There is liberty in your presence,
                There is peace in your presence,
                There is holiness in your presence....<br />
                We need your presence each day, take not your presence from your people o Lord....<br /><br />

                Enlighten what needs enlightened,
                Renew the areas within us that need renewal,
                Revive the areas that need revival,
                Lord, cause us to walk circumspect before you.
                Thank you, Lord, for bringing your bride into alignment. Thank you for raising a standard. Thank you for
                that revival haw started within the body,<br /><br />

                Now I see fires spread, fresh fires, each one is catching a light from the revival...each one is doing
                their part in whichever way, big or small God is leading His beloved to function as on Body, with one
                Spirit, single mindedly....<br /><br />

                Each goes fishing, winning souls, learning that a wise man wins a soul.... the fires are spreading; we
                are truly stepping into a new day.... fresh fires.... burning every impurity and making everything
                new... we praise you, Abba Father!!!<br /><br />
