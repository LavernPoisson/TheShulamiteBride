                9am to 12pm: <br /><br />

                Thanksgiving prayer.<br />
                Pray always I'm the Spirit....<br /><br />

                I will enter His gates with thanksgiving in my heart
                I will enter His courts with praise...<br /><br />

                Prayer Decrees for This Watch-
                This is a prayer watch that ALL should set aside, A time set aside to give thanks unto the Lord, ...
                The number 6 is the number of men.
                When we do this, we deny the flesh and give God the glory..."Let no flesh glorify in His presence" 1
                Corinthians 1:29<br /><br />

                In this time of laying aside everything to stand as one body giving thanks....
                This will open up the windows of heaven sending down rain of blessing upon blessings...
                Heavenly Father…
                You have gone before me to prepare my way, to make the crooked path straight and the rough places
                smooth.
                Father, I entrust my work to You and You cause my plans to succeed, and everything I set my hands to do
                prospers.
                (Proverbs 16:3)<br /><br />

                I am thankful Jehovah Shammah, you are already there, you have already gone ahead of me making every
                crooked place straight, I am thankful for the success and prosperity you have entrusted me with
                You are truly my Jehovah Jireh... your provisions are new every morning and new every day.<br /><br />

                Thank you Heavenly Father.....<br />
                Father, today I have favor with all who look upon me.Your favor makes a circle around me, enclosing me
                and covering me like a shield (Psalm 5:12).
                I am thankful, my El Shaddai for graciously giving me more than enough,
                that I find favor with You and men, thank you for being my shield and my refuge, A hiding place whenever
                I may need.<br /><br />

                You will work out Your plans for my life because your faithful love endures forever (Psalm 138:8).
                Elohim Ahavah! Thank you for loving me, thank you for directing my footsteps and guiding my
                path.<br /><br />

                In Jesus’ name, I entrust my work to You this day, and I know my plans will work out well. I can do
                everything You ask me to with the help of Jesus Christ Who gives me strength. (Proverbs
                16:3; Philippians 4:13)<br /><br />

                Because I reverence Your Name, Your goodness shines on me like the sun, with healing in its rays.
                (Malachi 4:2)
                Jehovah Raphe, thank you for creation, thank you for the healing rays of the sunlight that causes
                healing in my body, thank you for every witty invention and every design made that is purposed for my
                healing.<br /><br />

                I praise You and never forget how kind You are to me! Your loving-kindness.
                You forgive all my sins and heal all my sicknesses. You save me from the grave and surround me with Your
                loving-kindness and tender mercies. (Psalm 103:2-4) <br /><br />

                If I stumble, I will never fall, for He holds me by the hand. (Psalm 37:23-24)<br /><br />

                I take delight in the Lord, and He gives me my heart’s desires (Psalm 37:4).<br /><br />

                 I trust Him and I lack no good thing (Psalm 34:10).<br /><br />

                God supplies all my needs from His riches in glory because of what Christ Jesus has done (Philippians
                4:19.)<br /><br />

                Now, we have plenty to give to every good work (2 Corinthians 9:8) Thank You for choosing me to be your
                vessel, thank You for setting me apart for your Holiness.<br /><br />

                In addition, we have favor, good understanding and esteem in God’s sight and in the sight of man
                (Proverbs 3:4).
                Thank you for giving me favor, had it not been for your favor your good works would not be fulfilled in
                my life, but because of Your favor I am able to influence the areas you have given me to dominate,
                thank You El Gibor!! Mighty warrior, strong in battle....<br /><br />

                Today I take this moment to lay down my agenda, to lay down my program, to lay down my formalities and
                worship you, to give You all honor, to adore you and worship you, giving you the Glory because it
                belongs to you,<br /><br />

                Worship and praise the Father in Spirit and Truth, in one accord!!!<br /><br />

                Acts 2:15-21 AMP<br />
                These people are not drunk, as you assume, since it is [only] the third hour of the day (9:00 a.m.); but
                this is [the beginning of] what was spoken of through the prophet Joel:
                And it shall be in the last days,’ says God, ‘That I will pour out My Spirit upon all mankind.
                And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see [divinely prompted]
                visions, and your old men shall dream [divinely prompted] dreams.
                Even on My bondservants, both men and women, I will in those days pour out My Spirit And they shall
                prophesy.
                And I will bring about wonders in the sky above and signs (attesting miracles) on the earth below, Blood
                and fire and smoking vapor.
                The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, Before the great and glorious day of the
                Lord comes.
                And it shall be that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord [invoking, adoring, and worshiping the
                Lord Jesus] shall be saved (rescued spiritually).’
                Sing Praises....Worship in spirit and in truth.<br /><br />

                I give you the worship, I give you the praise, I adore you King of Kings and Lord of Lords
                Let your light shine upon your people,
                Let your presence engulf me, have your sweet way, come and fill this place, come and take your place, I
                give you preeminence over my surrounds.........<br /><br />
