                Be careful the words we speak, the words that we speak are life, able to turn situations around. God
                spoke and world was created.
                Let your words be few because they are precious, we will give an account for every word
                spoken.<br /><br />

                We are legislators, given dominion and authority to change the atmosphere to change the environment to
                change our surroundings<br />
                Matthew 12:36<br />
                Whatever we bind on earth is bound in heaven and whatever we loosen on earth is loosened in
                heaven.<br /><br />

                When we speak negativity it has an impact on the direction of our speech, for example every time that we
                say things won't work out, we see that things don't work out.<br /><br />

                I would like to share another scripture to bring my message together to make you realize the impact of
                the power of the tongue.<br /><br />

                 Proverbs 12:18, which states, "Thoughtless words cut like a sword, but the tongue of wise people brings
                healing". <br /><br />

                The words that we speak bring healing. So let us choose our words carefully.<br /><br />

                Isaiah 49:2: "He has made my mouth like a sharp sword, my tongue like a two-edged sword." 
                So basically, we are able to kill someone with our tongue,<br /><br />

                Have you ever considered the word of God that says a slanderer will not enter into the kingdom of
                heaven, neither will a murderer enter,
                Do you know how many times we have slandered and murdered our brother with the sword which is the
                tongue.<br /><br />

                The seriousness and the repercussions of what we speak,<br /><br />

                Let us unpack...<br />
                I mentioned before that We are legislators of this world and that we have been given dominion to
                dominate the arears that God has given us, that He has trusted us with.<br /><br />

                Matthew 6;10 teaches us to pray there is a portion that says "Your kingdom come your will be done on
                earth as it is in heaven,
                So, God's kingdom of Heaven is pure and undefiled, we pray heaven to earth, we declare whatever we bind
                in heaven is bound on earth...<br />
                So, The Heavens were created to mirror the earth, we suppose to pray this prayer, prayer is a form of
                communication using words creating change.<br /><br />

                Have you considered the many murders of this world, prostitution, abortion
                The word of God says... if the righteous can be barely saved what will happen to the sinless or
                godless....<br /><br />

                Now with that being said we have a responsibility as the church to guard what we say, by prayers and
                words of affirmation... what we speak is sent out in the atmosphere then we see the manifestation of it
                on earth... We say we are legislators, having domination but we are the result of the murders, abortions
                and prostitution when we use our words loosely. Let me explain...<br /><br />

                Every time we speak against things when we should not in the natural, we abort it in the Spirit by words
                spoken .... you see we are spirit first...As it is in heaven so shall it be on earth... so, we cause
                manifestation of an abortions on the earth...we see this by real abortions that take place around
                us...<br /><br />

                Every time we use the word of God for the benefit of self and not what it should be used for, we
                prosecute the gospel.... we see the manifestation of prostitution in a region
                Look at the condition of an area where you see the prostitution rate high, you are sure to find a
                company of believers that have prostituted the gospel for self-gain. As it is in heaven so shall it be
                on earth....<br /><br />

                Every time we murder each other with words we see the manifestation of killing in that specific place or
                region, look around you... It's not the devil...he has no power... we are causing the many disfunction
                by what we speak.<br /><br />

                We like to hear the good stuff; we want to be legislators.... Judge righteously " Watch over your words"
                remember earth was created with a word...
                the same power that raised Christ from the death lives within you.<br /><br />

                Change the order by changing what we speak and watching over our words...
                The repercussions for this are that a slanderer will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Neither will a
                Murderer, so we need to repent.
                I will guide you through repentance in my next blog.<br /><br />
