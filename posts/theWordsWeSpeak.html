                Be careful the words we speak, the words that we speak are life, able to turn situations around. God
                spoke and world was created.<br />
                Let your words be few because they are precious, we will give an account for every word
                spoken.<br /><br />

                We are legislators, given dominion and authority to change the atmosphere to change the environment to
                change our surroundings
                Matthew 12:36
                Whatever we bind on earth is bound in heaven and whatever we loosed on earth is loosed in
                heaven.<br /><br />

                When we speak negativity it has an impact on the direction of our speech, for example every time that we
                say things won't work out, we see that things don't work out.<br /><br />

                I would like to share another scripture to bring my message together to make you realize the impact of
                the power of the tongue.<br /><br />

                 Proverbs 12:18, which states, "Thoughtless words cut like a sword, but the tongue of wise people brings
                healing". <br /><br />

                The words that we speak bring healing. So let us choose our words carefully.<br /><br />

                Isaiah 49:2: "He has made my mouth like a sharp sword, my tongue like a two-edged sword." 
                So basically we are able to kill someone with our tongue,<br /><br />

                Have you ever considered the word of God that says a slanderer will not enter into the kingdom of
                heaven, neither will a murderer enter,
                Do you know how many times we have slandered and murdered our brother with the sword which is the
                tongue.<br /><br />

                Now to trully understand the seriousness of the power of the tongue and the words we speak, We are
                legislators of this world....<br /><br />

                The word of God says that when we pray...We pray: "As it is in heaven, so shall it be on earth."
                Have you considered the many murders of this world, the many abortions and prostitution...<br />
                It says if the righteous can be barely saved what will happen to the sinless or godless....<br /><br />

                Now with that being said we have a responsibility as the church to guard what we say, by constant
                prayers and words of affirmation... what we speak is sent out in the atmosphere then we see the
                manifestation of it on earth... We say we are legislators, having domination but we are the result of
                the murders, abortions and prostitution when we use our words loosely.<br /><br />

                Every time we speak against things that we think look right in our natural minds we abort in the Spirit
                by words spoken ....As it is in heaven so shall it be on earth... every time we use the word of God for
                the benefit of self and not what is used for, we prosecute the gospel.... we see the manifestation of
                prostitution in a region...As it is in heaven so shall it be on earth.
                We like to hear the good stuff; we want to be legislators.... Judge righteously " Watch over your words"
                remember earth was created with a word... the same power that raised Christ<br /><br />


                from the death lives within you.... change the order by changing what we speak and watching over our
                words...in Jesus' name Amen.<br /><br />
