                12 am-3 am: <br /><br />

                Spiritual warfare (The witching hour)<br /><br />

                Pray in the Spirit....<br />
                Prayer Decrees for This Watch<br />
                Heavenly Father…<br />
                I plea the blood of Jesus against all demonic activities of the night, any traps that are set now may it
                be demolished right now by fire in the name of Jesus.<br /><br />

                I decree and I declare Nightmares, torment and sleeplessness will not be your people's portion,
                I send back every opposing attack over the mind of our people right now; I command that it be sent back
                to sender
                May every witch and warlock see your power move through the airwaves of the night.... May they become
                tired and weary, may they become weak, every word spoken from the evil one be sent back.... We send back
                to sender right now
                They will turn from evil.
                They will turn from the darkness may they see your light.... illuminate your light so bright that it
                causes them not to see what they try to do. It will all fail in Jesus' name.
                Father, I ask that you protect our minds while we sleep.
                We will lie down and sleep in peace, for You alone, O Lord, will keep your beloved safe. (Psalms 4:8) 
                I praise You because You counsel me. Even at night, you put Your instructions deep inside my mind.
                Your Word is like a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path.
                (Proverbs 16:7; Psalm 119:105)<br /><br />

                In Jesus’ Name:<br />
                I spoil every attack of the enemy.
                I cancel and forcefully oppose any satanic operations and strategies which are designed to hinder and
                prevent Gods plans and purpose for my life from manifesting.<br /><br />

                It is written: Whatever we bind on earth is bound in heaven, and whatever we lose on earth is loosed in
                heaven.
                Therefore, through the name of Jesus and the power of His Blood,
                I bind and break all witchcraft, curses, spells, and powers of darkness working against me, against my
                family, against my ministry, against my home and everything that concerns me.<br /><br />

                I cancel every attack of oppression, depression, perversion, distraction, hindrance, and deception.
                I decree that no evil will befall me, or plague come near my dwelling.
                No weapon formed against me will prosper
                Lord, you order angels to protect everything concerning me.<br /><br />

                I decree that the rulers of the air will be brought to nought.
                I dismantle the plans of the evil one.
                I frustrate the works of the enemy.
                I declare confusion in the enemy's camp...
                I pray blindness over them that they won't know which way to go.... I shut their ear gates, I release a
                sound and bombard the airwaves shutting off every evil work, frustrate their plans in Jesus Mighty Name
                Give them no peace, torment them, until they see your power and bow to you in reverence and come to the
                fullness of understanding that you are our true God.<br /><br />

                Matthew 26:53<br />
                Jesus speaks: Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than
                twelve legions of angels.<br /><br />

                Thank you, Lord, for reminding us of your word, that we can call forth legions of angels to help war in
                this battle...<br /><br />

                I call upon the angels, raise up your armies, take your position and war against the rulers of darkness
                that try to take over our land,
                protect our land, and I give instructions that you will go forth and guard over each gate making sure
                that they are protected guarded and protected...<br /><br />

                Road rage be silenced in the name of Jesus, angels are in position on every corner of the street...
                Accidents be brought to nought in the name of Jesus... every trap of the enemy I declare it is null and
                void...The blood of Jesus over the streets of Africa in Jesus Mighty Name...<br /><br />

                Isaiah 60:18 “Violence shall no more be heard in your land, devastation or destruction within your
                borders; you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.”<br /><br />

                According to Isaiah 60:18 I declare this over my community, Violence shall not be heard over our land in
                the name of Jesus, Salvation has come to our nation this day, we will worship and praise at our gates
                and declare victory in our land in Jesus' name.<br /><br />

                I call the angels protect us, take your place and do what you are called to, rise up watch over your
                people watches over everything that concerns them.
                Protect the wisdom that God has provided us with, help us to use it the right way and not to be tempted
                like Eve in the Garden of Eden.<br /><br />

                Gabriel and Michael send forth messages bring back the peace, bring back the joy and righteousness, send
                messages to our father
                Open the channels of communication,
                For God's kingdom is righteousness peace and joy, this is the heritage of the children of the Lord, to
                those who Love the Lord, we are His prized possessions, we are God's chosen, we are royalty.<br /><br />

                Psalms 34,7<br />
                The angel of the Lord encamps all around those who fear Him and delivers them.
                Psalms 103:20<br />
                Bless the Lord, you His angels,
                Who excel in strength, who do His word,
                Heeding the voice of His word.
                The angels hear the word of the Lord and respond to the word of God.<br /><br />

                Now begin to see the angels walking up and down invisible staircases pouring out answers in dreams and
                visions once more,
                I see the angels arising helping us accomplish our God given assignments.<br /><br />

                Tarry in the midnight hour, proclaim that You are victorious in Christ who gives you strength, reclaim
                your strength, take back everything that has been taken from you...<br /><br />

                I see the battle getting pushed back. Thank you Lord,
                Thank you, Father, for sending forth the angels to partner with us in war, thank you that the Spirit of
                delay is broken over us.<br /><br />

                Thank you that the pathway has been made clear, thank God that the walls are erected and the gates are
                being guarded now, thank God for the answer are reaching earth now, the answers that have been fought
                over are all being released now...<br /><br />

                I speak the name of Jesus over my community, over my country.
                I declare that my community is rising up taking their position as the true Sons, proclaiming that the
                Kingdom of God is at hand, performing miracles signs and wonders in the mighty Name of Jesus.
                I speak the name of Jesus over our ministries you O Lord have trusted us with.
                Jesus, You, be the center of it all.
                I dismantle false associations that try to infiltrate my ministry...<br /><br />

                I speak the name of Jesus over my family, Pray spiritual blindness be removed from their eyes may they
                step into everything that you have purposed for them.
                I thank you Lord that as for me and my household we will serve the Lord.<br /><br />

                I declare that help is on the way, to our wayward sons and daughters to make proper concise decisions
                concerning their lives,
                I declare that the youth will be raised up in this hour, that they may be given dreams and visions
                giving them clear instructions, removing the scales from their eyes... A Joshua generation a force
                rising up... let it come o Lord from our families, from our homes, from amongst us Lord, let us see the
                fruit of our labor in this lifetime.
                I declare their conscience is not tarnished but is now clear to know right from wrong.
                I declare no condemnation of the past will hold back our loved ones from stepping into
                salvation.<br /><br />

                I declare Godly counsel in Government, I dismantle the works of the enemy
                I dismantle ungodly alters in Government
                I declare that righteous leaders will be raised up, that will stand and judge righteously.
                Bring back the Nehemiah's of this day that will build the walls on behalf of his people, bring back
                unity in our land...

                Take back everything that was taken from us and push back the darkness in Jesus Mighty
                Name...<br /><br />

                Paul and Silas were released from prison in this hour, pray that the prison of our minds be set free in
                Jesus' name, that the prison of abandonment, rejection hurt pain be set free in Jesus' name,
                That our homelands be set free, that the prison of our lands be set free in Jesus' name.
