                Psalms 23:1-6 NKJV<br /><br />
                [1] The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br /><br />

                What do you have need of today, the word of God say's you shall not want'<br />
                Is the Lord your shepherd? Who are you following?<br />
                In your following, are you finding fulfillment?<br />
                'I shall not want'<br />
                Meaning I lack nothing, everything I have is found in my Shepherd.<br />

                [2] He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters. [3] He restores my
                soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name’s sake.<br /><br />

                Can I ask this question? Have you experienced the Kingdom of God?
                The kingdom of God is given to us, made up of righteousness, peace and joy...
                "He makes us" meaning that He causes us to".... rest IN His peace, IN His provision, IN His love.
                His green pastures are abundance
                His still waters are the Peace of His Spirit.
                When your soul is restored, every hurt and pain of past is redeemed, made new and salvation has come.<br /><br />

                He leads me. I keep seeing how He leads me...."He leads me for His name's sake" His name is above every
                other name, His name has so many facets and meanings, I can call Apon His name... He is Mighty Algibor,<br />
                "Mighty One"<br />
                Jehovah-Rophe "Healer"<br />
                Jehovah Jireh "Provider"<br />
                Shalom " God of peace"<br />
                Emmanuel" He is with us"<br />
                For His name's sake, I have direct access to every provision just by calling on His name.<br /><br />

                [4] Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with
                me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.<br /><br />

                Do you have the reassurance and affirmation, that if you are in the valley, God is with you.... make no
                mistake in this Faith walk, there will always be valleys and mountains.<br /><br />

                Yes, there are valleys? What does your valley look like,
                Do you know that your character is being built in the valley, it is what sets you apart and when you
                come out the valley, whatever ministered to you in that place is what will you will minister when you
                step out of the valley, make sure that you allow God to be your minister in that moment.
                Misunderstanding your season or feeling like you alone, becoming bitter or resentful in the valley will
                cause you to stumble and fall, it will bring out the ugly version of yourself and that is not Gods
                intention for you.
                The valley builds character; it teaches humanity and shows humility and love.<br /><br />

                I have good news; God wants to walk you out of your valley... God wants to remove the fear and place it
                with faith, He wants to redefine who you think you are and He wants to strip away the mindset of your
                past, never despise the valley...
                God is with you, "Yea though I walk through...
                Remember that you are walking THROUGH!
                Your rod and Your staff, your strength, your guidance, your correction, your discipline they comfort me
                and I embrace your discipline, because you love those that you chastise and discipline.
                "The righteous run into it and they saved"<br /><br />

                [5] You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.<br /><br />

                I would like to expound on the word "Enemy" because when we think of enemy first thing we think about
                are people..."please don't get me wrong" those that go against God are His enemy.

                Think about the economy, think about poverty, think about communities where drug addiction and violence
                are rife.
                Think about sickness these are all enemies; sickness is an enemy...

                Now picture this...if you have been diagnosed with illness, yet you are able to rise above what you
                faced with and more so if you are able to function despite the sickness, it means that you have defeated
                that enemy...
                you have raised above that
                " You are seated in the presence of sickness' God prepared a table for you to overcome despite the
                sickness,
                despite the circumstances that surround you telling you that you can't make it ...

                Think about rising above your circumstances, poverty...
                It is also an enemy, poverty is an enemy... "Psalms 23.1 says that we shall not want, meaning that we
                have everything we need. So, if the word of God says it and we find ourselves in lack or poverty, it
                becomes the enemy because it goes against the word of God....<br /><br />

                Anything that goes against the word of God is the enemy, and so there are many that find themselves in
                the presence of the enemy... but I have a message and a sound word, God has prepared a table for you
                today and He wants you to take heed of His word.
                He has sent forth His angels to anoint your head with oil...
                Perhaps you feel that this message can't be for you because you have been the one feeling like the
                enemy, perhaps you have been feeling ashamed, disappointed hurt, abused abandoned.
                Perhaps you don't understand what you are going through, and you don't know who you are in Christ, so
                you are feeling like your own worst enemy... but I have news for you, you are in transition and God is
                with you in the valley, in that place of decision, in that place of isolation and ailment.
                God is revealing who you are in Him, your identity is not attached to things that are perishable, things
                that decay.... this life too shall pass away but you are of and incorruptible seed, you are a chosen
                generation and a royal priesthood.
                You are the head and not the tail, you are above and not beneath.<br /><br />

                So, as you rise above and walk THROUGH the situation of the circumstance.
                God leads you; He guides you; He sustains you, His mercy is all around you.
                You have to eat the word of God and apply faith; you have to believe that He is with you in the valley
                and once you do.... then His mercy and goodness follow you all the days of your life.
                You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over. [6] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the
                days of my life; And I will dwell in the house of the Lord Forever....<br /><br />

                To dwell, becomes a place of refuge,
                A hiding place, the place you reside in becomes Gods dwelling place...

                Dwelling in the house of the Lord Forever

                The word Forever, is eternal... we are promised this... you see all of the Earth will pass away but
                there is an eternity...

                Today you may be asking yourself what eternity looks like or what will we be doing...
                We are created to worship God; we are created to carry the presence of the living God.
                Anything out of the presence of God will not experience the fullness of the Father...
                Today He invites you to experience him in His fullness....<br /><br />

                Psalms 23 is a scripture lived out to those that have surrendered themselves to the father,
                We must learn how to walk in His Love, in His rest in everything that He has promised us...<br /><br />

                We shall not want<br />
                He restores my soul<br />
                Fear no evil<br />
                God is our comforter<br />
                Rising above poverty, sickness<br />
                goodness and mercy follow me.<br /><br />

                We can only find all of this by entering into a relationship with Him.
                Amen, I pray you are blessed and encouraged<br /><br />
