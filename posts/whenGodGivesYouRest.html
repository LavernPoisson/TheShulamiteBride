                you have a duty to help others find rest too.<br /><br />

                Joshua 1:13-15 NIV<br />
                “Remember the command that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you after he said, ‘The Lord your God will
                give you rest by giving you this land.’<br /><br />

                Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the
                Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites.
                You are to help them until the Lord gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have
                taken possession of the land the Lord your God is giving them.<br /><br />

                After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east
                of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”
                God gives rest to His chosen, God gives rest to His beloved. God makes provision for His people, and for
                their families.<br /><br />

                What is interesting in the verse above is that when the called-out ones are called to battle, it says
                your wives, children and livestock stay in the land that Moses gave.
                We know that Moses didn't take the Joshua generation into the promise land, that he passed away before
                entering the promised land, but we also see that land was already given to him and his family.
                His family had a place where they could rest.<br /><br />

                The word of God also says that we are to help our fellow Israelites until He gives rest, like he has
                done for you and me.
                This really stood out to me, you see we live in a world where the grace of God takes many families out
                of situations that the enemy has infiltrated, God brings us out of those situations, then says help
                those that still need to find rest.... what does help look like to you this day.<br /><br />

                Remember God helped you and your family and gave you rest, think about it and see how u can become a
                blessing in someone's life, through ministry of helps, praying for one another. Through serving or by
                simply speaking and encouraging someone. Directing and guiding the next, making provision if that's what
                it would take to give that person rest.<br /><br />

                In the book of Acts we read and see how everyone grew in wealth and riches sharing everything...there
                was none feeble amongst them.<br /><br />

                Is this what God wants? that we share with each other. Is this not the order of heaven?
                We pray let your kingdom come and let your will be done yet God looks down from His Holy sanctuary
                saying, I have given you all the keys, all the authority. I shared my ways with you, the nature of whom
                I AM. I gave you my only Son to teach you to hold onto to nothing, but in doing this to show you what
                Love I have for you, to show you how to be selfless... These are the keys to unlock the Mystery of my
                Kingdom. But many have obtained wealth and riches and have forgotten that there are others that need to
                enter into the promised land,<br /><br />

                We want to bind and loose stuff and take dominion in the realms of the spirit and yes, it's important to
                do all that but what about simple gestures of kindness.<br />

                Help until they too can take possession and obtain the promise land.<br />

                After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east
                of the Jordan toward the sunrise.<br />

                This brings me to closing, sometimes there is a call for separation a sacrifice that would take you away
                from your loved one's beloved, chosen one as you so journey... <br /><br />

                Sometimes we think that we suppose to cross the Jordan with the ones we are taking through, yet the Lord
                already provided land East of the Jordon.
                God could place you anywhere but how is it that you are placed East of the City toward the
                sunrise?<br /><br />

                When I think of sunrise I think of the Glory of God, all His supremacy all of His Illumination and all
                of His love shining so bright... There are promises that have been given without even crossing the
                Jordon for self but if you just stay true to your core, stay true to everything that God has given you
                whether across the Jordon or not, it doesn't really matter provided His presence remain with you....East
                side toward the sunrise really is a promise of God. I pray that you find encouragement and that this
                message inspires you to walk out this race fully convinced no matter what where or how God is
                Able.<br /><br />
