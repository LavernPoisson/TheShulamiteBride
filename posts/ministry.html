                The meaning of the word "Ministry" implies a sense of being duty-bound to work under God's
                authority.<br /><br />

                The mistake that many believers make is thinking that ministry is only associated to one part of their
                lives, and this is works of God pertaining to the Church, Ministry in a church building only. Ministry
                in serving in the Body of Christ using talents for worship, ushering, pastoring... when out of the
                Church building people go on with daily lives and forget to serve with the same tenacity or passion out
                of the church building.<br /><br />

                A person that is born again, saved by the grace of God and comes to the full understanding of what a
                servant of God is knows and has a revelation of Ministry.<br /><br />

                When one views life, we are all called to serve...Servants of God every action taken is ministering to
                someone or to a situation.
                So, when we are ministering to everything around us, Ministry becomes a daily consistent intentional
                dying to oneself and serving.<br /><br />

                Ministry is not only in a church, but also daily living. The platforms that God has placed you in is
                Ministry... If you are called to the corporate industry that is your platform to minister. Through acts
                of kindness, through your heart of servant hood, through your acts of unselfishness.<br /><br />

                If you are called to be a housewife, that is the place that God will use you most to share your gifts
                and abilities.<br /><br />

                If you are called to the church to be a blessing to the Body of Christ, that is where God will use you
                to impact and impart.<br /><br />

                Your core function will always be where God has called you, make sure to find out this place by spending
                time in Christ ...<br /><br />

                Life will always be ministry to others, you have your core function but ultimately your life and acts of
                unselfishness will always be ministry to others. " That is Ministry"<br /><br />
