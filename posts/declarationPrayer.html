                Isaiah 49:25 NKJV<br />
                But thus says the Lord:<br />
                “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,
                And the prey of the terrible will be delivered, For I will contend with him who contends with you,
                And I will save your children.
                I declare according to Isaiah 49:25
                God is contending with whom ever contends with me.<br />
                Give "IT" no peace concerning me.<br />
                Give "IT" no peace concerning my seed.<br />

                You are a Father to the Fatherless, my children belong to you.<br /><br />

                Through the covenant of the blood of the lamb, I am remembered this day....<br />
                I send out a decree to the heavens and the earth: my children are a blessed nation.
                my children are a sought-after nation.
                My children have obtained the blessing of the Lord because they belong to you o' Lord.
                Mercy and grace follow them all the days of their lives.
                My children will accomplish everything that is set in their path.
                The purpose of God over their lives will be fulfilled.
                The path that they are on will be directed according to the mandate of heaven.
                Every accusation, every cursed word,every slander is broken over their lives in Jesus' name.
                The clock has been set and re- calibrated according to the divine order of heaven.<br /><br />

                There is no injustice that can come and corrupt the plans of the Father.<br />
                It has been decided this day in the courts of heaven
                Repentance, reconciliation and restoration is their portion and we are victorious through Christ who
                strengthens us.
                There are no pending judgements or any judgements holding my seed back from thriving.
                This is the word of the Lord; this is His children's heritage; the blessing of the Lord will surely
                overtake them.<br />
                The heavens have decided this day, today, that they will walk in every heavenly blessing.
                My kids are given a clean slate, a new start
                It is a new day, it is a new beginning
                I decree and declare this into the heavenlies.
                Everything that has been taken away is now being returned in the name of Jesus.
                Every delay set out to frustrate the will of God concerning my family is brought to naught in the name
                of Jesus.
                Every deception or confusion is disrupted by the power of the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />

                A Holy Ghost disruption over the airwaves, over the areas where my children reside...<br /><br />

                Arise, arise, arise, step into purpose, step into alignment, and step into God's blessings for your life
                and family.<br />
                I command angelic activity right now to be dispatched
                I command the angels to fight on my behalf and make every crooked place straight right now in Jesus'
                mighty name.<br /><br />

                God's seed will flourish in the name of Jesus.
                I thank you Lord that you are the deliverer over all things.
                I have this assurance that your word has gone forth, that your word has been spoken over my kids in
                Jesus' name.
                Your word has been spoken it will not return void it will accomplish that which it has been sent out to
                for.
                Your word has been sent forth: "My kids are saved."<br /><br />

                Let God arise; His enemies are scattered. Let God arise; His enemies are scattered<br /><br />

                In Jesus' mighty name, amen and amen.<br />
                The prayers of the righteous truly avail much.<br /><br />
