                3am to 6am: <br /><br />

                Command your morning: Enter into the throne room, a time of intimacy in Christ.<br /><br />

                Enter into the throne room become fully aware of the Lord being present with you... Be reminded of the
                Lord, He walked on the waters in the 4th watch, (Matthew 14:25-33)<br /><br />

                Peter got out of the boat, walked on the waters keeping his eyes fixed on our Lord, forget about the
                storms and the sounds of the winds during this time stay focused on our King....
                Spend time coming into complete intimacy, gaze into His eyes,
                wait on the Lord to hear if there is anything He needs to say.... gazing our eyes and keeping them fixed
                teaches us to trust, it was when Peter took His eyes off Jesus did, he begin to sink.<br /><br />

                In this time spiritual sensitivity is extremely heightened, yes, the demonic forces are in full
                operation, the winds are extremely high, the evil is extremely thick...
                it is important for us to remember that just as demonic activities are high... the presence of the Lord
                is higher than any ruler or principalities of darkness...
                Becoming one with the father in this time allows intimacy to work on your behalf of you without any
                effort...
                Victory belongs to the Lord...
                You begin to walk on waters; you begin to rise above every circumstance you begin to hear the father
                direct you in the way you should go...<br /><br />

                Those who wait upon the Lord in prayer, those who tarry in His presence,
                God will renew your strength
                Despite the winds that are all around
                Shift your focus and be still in the presence of the most high,
                Have you ever just waited on the Lord for a word knowing that word would carry you throughout the day...
                Wait in His presence and wait again...<br /><br />

                Many want to warfare in this watch, but God is calling you to total intimacy in Him in this hour, He
                wants to renew your strength in Him in this hour,
                He will speak mysteries to you in this hour, Let His presence illuminates your entire surroundings as
                you yield to Him.
                He has already defeated death, hell and the grave.<br /><br />

                Luke 12:37 NKJV<br />
                Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Assuredly, I say to you
                that he will gird himself and have them sit down to eat and will come and serve them.<br /><br />

                Supp with the Lord, be totally immersed in His presence... Allow Him to whisper in your ears, mysteries
                of deep calling unto deep...
                you have stepped out of warfare in the previous watch into His embrace ....<br /><br />

                "Watch" is mentioned 24 times in the New Testament…all with focus on being alert.  Jesus’ command to
                watch is mentioned most during His last 3 days on earth.   <br /><br />

                "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, his enemy
                came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way," Matthew 13:24-25.<br /><br />

                Watch and pray.... Watch and pray...watch and pray...
                Listen and pray.... listen and pray.... listen and pray<br /><br />

                God is looking for Samuel's today who will respond to Him when the 3am wake-up call comes by saying, 
                he responds,<br /><br />

                "Speak, says Samuel for your servant is listening"<br /><br />

                Speak Lord, your servant is listening, Speak mysteries Lord, I am listening!!!
                Speak Lord, my heart awaits... speak Lord the answer is coming....<br /><br />

                Luke 12:37 NKJV<br />
                Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Assuredly, I say to you
                that he will gird himself and have them sit down to eat and will come and serve them. <br /><br />

                This is not just an idea but a real provoking of the Holy Spirit upon God's people to ignite spiritual
                awakening, breakthrough and Kingdom advance in days of increasing darkness and conflict.
                Jesus is coming for an alert and ready bride.  Let us be ready with oil in our lamps, Matthew
                25:5-7.<br /><br />

                Let us fill our lamps up with oil, fill your oil lamps up for the road is long for there are traps along
                the way that only can only be taken out when our jars are full of oil...<br /><br />

                Isaiah 10:27: “The yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.”<br /><br />

                The anointing is found in intimacy with God; the anointing comes from having our lamps
                filled.<br /><br />

                Prayer Decrees for This Watch Now I can command my morning: having a completely new view. Now I can
                command my morning in an elevated place....<br /><br />

                You are my God; the Rock I run to for protection. Moreover, you are my shield, the power that saves me,
                and my place of safety. Father, you will defeat my enemies. When they come against me, they will scatter
                before me in seven directions! (Psalm 18:2; Deuteronomy 28:7).<br /><br />

                You know the plans You have for me. They are plans for my welfare and not for evil, to give me hope and
                a good future. (Jeremiah 29:11)

                Today I commit my work to You, and my plans will succeed. Therefore, your favor rests upon me and makes
                everything I do successful.
                (Psalm 90:17; Proverbs 16:3)<br /><br />

                Your angels daily surround and defend me because I reverence You. I trust in You and find new strength.
                Therefore, I can rise up like an eagle in the sky and run and not get tired. I can also walk and not
                grow weak. (Isaiah 40:31)<br /><br />

                Exodus 14:14 The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.<br /><br />

                Give God all the praise for a new dawn is arising, a new hope and promises forever more,<br />
                Declare victory!<br />
                Declare super abundant grace!<br />
                Declare righteousness!<br />
                Declare freedom!<br /><br />

                "Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, 'The work is great and
                extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall.  Wherever you hear the sound of the
                trumpet, rally to us there.  Our God will fight for us.'”  
                (Nehemiah 4:19-20)<br /><br />

                Today we have heard the sound,<br />
                we have rallied together,<br />
                we are not separated on this wall,<br />
                we understand the assignment,<br />
                we have answered the call...<br />
                God you are fighting for us,<br />
                God commands a blessing in unity
                We believe in your word, you have commanded the blessing, a blessing in our homes and in our
                communities, in our areas of work.... we are blessed going in and blessed coming out.
                We make bold declarations of the blessings by faith....<br /><br />

                Sound the alarm of praise, sound the alarm of victory, sound the alarm of freedom!!!<br /><br />
