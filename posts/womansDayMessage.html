                <li><b>A Message From God...</b></li>
                <li>To the woman in despair, used by others for self-gain. Part of you feel incomplete, taken for
                    granted,

                    efforts;
                    I see how you pour into others how selfless you are. Never feel you are taken for granted, don’t you
                    know that it is better to give than to receive, the moments that you feel discouraged or in despair

                    to Me, I am your source, and I will pour rivers of living waters into your innermost parts which

                <li>To the woman who is experiencing a sense of hopelessness, you have been struggling with a cheating
                    partner, an abusive relationship, and a controlling narcissist. You have suffered rape and all sorts
                    of
                    mental and verbal abuse; you don’t know which way to turn. I know the struggles you have been faced
                    with
                    nothing is hidden from My sight, it has not been My intention for you to be inflicted or harmed,
                    humanity has become wicked and lovers of self. I know the hurt and the pain you have endured whether
                    you
                    have chosen to stay in that abuse or not. No one deserves to be hurt."I see all things" Help is on
                    the
                    way, I have heard your cry, your tears have all come to Me, every last drop is stored up, you may
                    feel
                    hopeless..I am with you I will even make my bed in hell with you. The time is coming and is now that
                    there is a recompense for every tear that has been shed. An outpouring of rain of many tears, but
                    this
                    time they will be tears of joy, tears of hope, tears of courage. Believe me. I set things apart, I
                    also
                    set things in order, and your affliction will not last. Help is on its way, won’t you turn your eyes
                    on
                    Me once more, I am the Author and Finisher of all things, I will perfect everything that which
                    concerns
                    you.</li>

                <li>To the woman attending to her family, making the sacrifice of being the home executive.
                    I am all-knowing, I have created you with a strong capability to fulfil a calling that is the
                    highest
                    form of servanthood. I have seen your sacrifice, I know your longing and desire for more, I am the
                    Creator of all things, who would tend the field of family, who would impart into my precious seed.
                    Who
                    would reveal what the order of the church in marriage would look like if it weren’t for you, a woman
                    of
                    the Highest God? You are exactly where you need to be, you have been my brain in family and a true
                    workmanship that should never feel ashamed. A warhead in prayer, full of selflessness, full of
                    humility
                    a heart of compassion. Don’t you know the demand and trust I have placed within you having to carry
                    your
                    family as you do, I know it’s not that simple, you sometimes wish it could be different for you, do
                    you
                    know that others also wish and desire to be exactly where you are. I have given you a task that
                    could
                    never be completed by any other. You are so special in my sight, your reward is heavenly, your
                    reward is
                    great.</li>

                <li>To the working-class woman who works a 9 to 5 or whatever shift she must work to keep the money
                    rolling
                    in because she simply has no other choice.
                    You are a rare choice of a fine diadem, I know what you have put up with in the work industry, I
                    know
                    your frustration and the times that you felt like giving up but instead, you pushed forward. You
                    have
                    left your kids at home, this has been painful as others grew them up. You have kept your head above
                    waters, you managed to smile when deep down you cried and wondered, “Will I ever get that promotion,
                    do
                    they even recognise my capability.” You see I have graced you and strengthened you, I will continue
                    to
                    add grace and strength I need you in the field you are in who will reach out to the lost and broken
                    if I
                    had not strategically placed you in that position. Set your face as flint and allow me to promote
                    you
                    and open doors that no man will shut.</li>

                <li>To the single woman who desires a relationship, she may or may not have a choice in her singleness.
                    Many are called few are chosen, A married woman tends to her family tends to her husband. She has
                    her
                    place and yes, it is a beautiful place I have given her; but your place is just as beautiful; it is
                    a
                    gift that I have given both of you. I your God has called you in your singleness to partner with me
                    we
                    have so much work to do, you will be single minded seeing my plans and my purpose, see my vision you
                    will be able to deliver my messages from a pure place being one with me, come a little higher come
                    and
                    see what I see then you will no longer wish for what I have not intended for you, Who can ascend to
                    the
                    heavens he who has clean hands and a pure heart, your singleness comes with purity and a deep focus
                    for
                    my heavenly design. It is a gift that I have created especially for you, can you please partner with
                    me
                    now that you have insight on what it is I have called you to. There are many more like you that are
                    trapped, when they see your boldness and courage, they will then step out of the fear of feeling
                    they
                    are alone, they will see me work through you.</li>

                <li>To the barren woman that so desires to bear a child but is without
                    I am your God, who can fathom my ways or process my thoughts, Children are a gift from God a
                    heritage
                    and those who have them have, have their quiver full, My gifts come from within and come from afar,
                    I
                    looked the face of the earth to see the futility of this land but if everyone were fruitful then who
                    would sow seeds of love, if I gave you your own would you stop caring for others. I made a way to
                    bring
                    balance knowing fully well that you would have the heart and compassion for others, who told you
                    that
                    you are barren, for I have not just given you one or two, but I have blessed with nations. I know
                    that
                    you will use this gift and navigate it the way I intended. In me there is no lack so you are not
                    without. I bring good news of tidings and joy to the many sorrows that you once felt. Continue to
                    give
                    me your highest praise and rejoice for who knows the hour of my restoration, recompense or
                    reconciliation.</li>

                <li>To the woman that has studied day and night, to pursue her career.
                    I am proud of you; I stand in awe when I see how you are using every cell in your body to grow and
                    learn. Learning is a big part of my kingdom; you see in my kingdom there is constant room to grow
                    and
                    learn. You are exactly where you need to be. I want to remind you that I am the giver of all things
                    and

                    kingdoms
                    and who shuts them down, never feel that you are above any other ‘I will continue to pour myself In
                    you

                    that your gifts and talents are being sharpened to impact nations and empower many that I will set
                    before you.
                    I am pouring out My wisdom and I am gracing you for the task, so let your light shine before all
                    mankind.</li>

                <li>To the woman that has placed herself in business, who has succeeded as an entrepreneur.
                    I have seen your perseverance, your stamina and courage. You have displayed a heroic role in
                    achieving
                    everything that I have placed inside of you. I am very pleased with your efforts and long sleepless
                    nights of dedication have not gone unnoticed, you have stood in diverse situations overcoming many
                    trails, there were many whispers of wanting to give up and yet you have stood the test of time. I
                    have
                    been with you throughout; I have provided you with every tool necessary to achieve the assignment
                    set
                    before you. I am the giver of all things good and bad, when I bless you with good things it is for
                    my
                    glory, it is for you to display my goodness through you, I have made you the hands and feet to help
                    in
                    places that only you can reach. Use what I have given you so that others will be drawn and learn
                    that I
                    am real through your acts of giving and nurturing what I have given to you so freely.</li>

                <li>To the woman who has lost her life partner, husband, child.
                    I know your pain, I know what you have endured when I gave my only Son, I felt every expression of
                    loss
                    and despair. After all you are made in my image, so I know what pain feels like. I cry with you
                    every
                    single time, your tears are mine, and your pain is mine. You may not have understood the loss you
                    experienced or why you had to go through it. I want you to know I have created myself in you, when
                    you
                    grieve, I grieve with you and its okay to grieve, the reason I have given you tears to cry, your
                    tears
                    will heal you as time goes on and you begin to understand, it will take time, time also heals every
                    pain; My heart is with you. I am close to the brokenhearted and to the contrite in spirit, I promise
                    to
                    complete you and be with you always. There is springtime there is winter, and in each season we are
                    either sowing or reaping whatever season you are in; you are positioned to fulfil a purpose. Each
                    one of
                    you is destined with purpose and what is most important is to find the purpose that I have placed
                    inside
                    of you.
                    I sent my only Son, the sacrifice of watching him carry a cross for the sake of humanity, for the
                    sake
                    of salvation. I cried with Him when He was nailed to the cross. That was His purpose, He sits on my
                    right side reigning and ruling with me, When you find your purpose you will understand death, you
                    will
                    understand life, you will understand my plans, they are good they do give hope.
                    Seek me and you will find life. It is the Glory of God to conceal a matter, it is the honour of
                    kings to
                    search it out. I have made each one of you precious in my sight a king in royalty. Search out my
                    mystery
                    of life with your entire being then you will be complete, then you will be fulfilled. Then you will
                    know
                    my ways. Then you will acknowledge that every good and perfect gift comes from the Father of Light.
