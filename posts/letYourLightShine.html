            <p class="post-text">What is light?<br /><br />

                A natural agent that stimulates sight and makes things visible.<br /><br />

                Light is able to illuminate any dark place, Light can fit through any cracks in any wall, Light can
                reach as
                far as its shine dependant on its strength, an example if a globe is not fully charged it could only
                Light
                up a smaller space within the room as a pose to a fully charged Light bulb Light has the ability to
                bounce
                off surfaces changing its direction so it is flexible.<br /><br />

                Similar words are<br />
                illumination<br />
                brightness<br />
                luminosity<br />
                shining<br />
                gleaming<br />
                brilliance<br />
                radiance<br />
                glow<br />
                blaze<br />
                glare<br />
                dazzle<br />

                Light has the ability to make (something) start burning or to ignite.<br /><br />

                1 John 1:5-7<br />
                This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness
                at
                all.<br />
                1 John 1:6<br />
                 If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the
                truth.<br />
                1 John 1:7<br />
                But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood
                of
                Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.<br /><br />

                So who is light ? God is light, and in Him there is no darkness<br /><br />

                We need to ask ourselves are we truly living in Him, you see to truly live in Him we have to let go of
                ourselves, our own will, our own desires.
                The word of God is Light and the word of God washes over us and brings light to our darkness, We are
                transformed by His light. Our minds are renewed by the power of the word of God<br /><br />

                Genesis 1:27 we are made in the image of God.<br />
                We are made in the image of God.
                I want to ask this question again, Who is light?
                So if the bible says that we are made in God's image, God is Light, we are also light.<br /><br />

                How can your light shine?<br />
                1 John 1:7<br />
                But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood
                of
                Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.<br /><br />

                To say that we have fellowship with one another, means that we have fellowship with the Holy Spirit, we
                live
                in a world where man has chased after the anointing, chased after the gift, chased after the blessing
                but
                never really chased after the Giver of all things.<br /><br />

                We say we in fellowship with the Holy Spirit but we fail to be in fellowship with our brother and
                sister, We
                in fellowship with the Holy Spirit but we speak ill of of neighbors, we say we have fellowship with the
                Holy
                Spirit yet we can't help others, God is Love and some times our hearts are turned away from our family
                and
                loved ones there is no love in our hearts.<br /><br />

                God wants to restore the fellowship with you and I today, God wants to restore us back to Him
                You see there is this loneliness that is happening within the body of Christ. Woman desires to have her
                husband,
                What is really happening is that God is longing to have fellowship with His people, The Holy Spirit is
                longing to spend quality time with us.<br /><br />

                We live in a world where we are pressed on every side, the pressures of life can come and do so much
                harm.
                We have kids to take care of, relationships to nuture, jobs to sustain, everything be pulling at us and
                demanding our attention.
                We become so caught up in life that we can neglect ourselves and neglect also our creator. Who has
                created
                heaven and earth.<br /><br />

                In order for us to identify with the question how can our light shine, we have to and must understand
                the
                life of our example Jesus Christ.
                If you have never experienced or encountered Christ then it is impossible to be enlightened or to
                experience
                light.<br /><br />

                Let us re learn our Creator and let us identify some of His experiences and let us relate to Him so that
                our
                Light can begin to shine.<br /><br />
