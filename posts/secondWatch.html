                9pm to 12am:<br /><br />

                Intercessory prayer, to pray for the protection of ourselves and those around us, pray for provisions in
                the different spheres of influence.<br /><br />

                Pray in the Spirit for at least half / one hour or more, then begin to decree and declare<br /><br />

                Romans 8:26-27 NKJV<br />
                Likewise, the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we
                ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
                [27] Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession
                for the saints according to the will of God.<br /><br />

                I declare that the blood of Jesus forms a hedge of protection around me, my family and our home.
                The blood of Jesus hides us from all demonic personalities, making it difficult for them to effectively
                track or trace us in the realm of the spirit.<br /><br />

                I declare that no weapon formed against us will prosper and every accusation from the kingdom of
                darkness will be disintegrated in Jesus Name.<br /><br />

                I lose my family, I lose ministry, I lose my loved ones and myself from every evil curse, spells,
                incantations, psychic powers and sorceries that have attached themselves to me or my family bloodline.
                We are set free, made whole, hidden under the shadow of the Almighty.
                I declare these curses are null and void, in Jesus’ Name.
                I come up against every evil alter where my name is mentioned, my family, my loved ones, my community,
                the schools, I make mention of the blood of Jesus, The blood of Jesus speaks for me and my loved
                ones.<br /><br />

                I cancel every generational curse, cut off anything that is not of God that has come to frustrate the
                will of God over our homes in our communities, over our families.
                In the name of Jesus, I break off every power of the kingdom of darkness and cancel every proud idea
                that has established itself against Gods plans for my life. I speak against the Spirit of delay,
                I bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.<br /><br />

                I take possession and speak to every sphere of influence in the name of Jesus, every sphere of influence
                will be occupied by Godly people that are in right standing with God.
                o Lord you said that we must occupy until You come.... ( Luke 19:13)<br /><br />

                Isaiah 66:8-13<br />
                [Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to give birth in one day?
                Or shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her children.
                Shall I bring to the time of birth and not cause delivery?” says the Lord. “Shall I who cause delivery
                shut up the womb?” says your God.<br /><br />

                Over every family that is not serving the Lord, I pray the set time is now! Delivery will take place; I
                stand on your word o Lord.
                Your Word is just and pure, you have brought us to delivery and will cause us to deliver in Jesus name.
                Thank you, Father, that a nation can be born in a day, thank you that my family are taking their
                rightful place in the kingdom of God.<br /><br />

                Thank you, Lord, for delivering our loved ones....<br /><br />

                Deuteronomy 9:20 NKJV<br />
                [20] And the Lord was very angry with Aaron and would have destroyed him; so, I prayed for Aaron also at
                the same time.<br /><br />

                I pray for our pastors and leaders that have brought judgement apon themselves that were given
                assignments that would have impacted communities, that were not able to carry out what was given, I pray
                and ask God to reverse impending judgements against them.
                I bring our leaders to your throne room o Lord, have mercy Father......pray for our leaders.
                Gods appointed, pray that they don't fall into temptation, pray that they lead righteously, pray for
                integrity and Godly counsel, pray that positions won't make them go astray, pray for humility and
                teachable spirits, pray for openness and transparency.
                Pray that leaders that lead have a deep passion in what they do, that they have love for
                humanity.<br /><br />

                Unless the Lord builds the house,
                They labor in vain who build it.
                Unless the Lord guards the city, The watchman stays awake in vain. (Psalm 127:1)<br /><br />

                Lord, you put leaders in position, you remove leaders from their position, everything happens from you,
                for you and for your purpose, you have chosen the set men and woman of God to lead...
                I pray for discernment in the Body of Christ, that each building according to your design. So that no
                one will labor in vain
                Help and teach us to pray in alignment with your word...<br />
                Help us to pray for all leaders including the unjust leader because you have placed them in that
                position.<br /><br />

                Let your perfect will be done, who can understand your ways, you have reason for everything that you do.
                Give us the grace and the wisdom to understand Your mind to understand your works, your works are
                beautiful and in your time all things are made beautiful.<br /><br />

                For the kingdom is the LORD’s, And He rules over the nations.” (Psalm 22:28, Government)<br /><br />

                Declare a holy alignment of the nation’s civil laws to God’s laws.

                Isaiah 64:1-4 When intersession breaks through stand and prays for the religious acts to be dismantled
                Pray against the spirit of religion, that exalt itself higher than the name of the Lord.

                Declare that no longer will the gospel be prostituted,
                Command the spirit of religion be broken, against the spirit of religion
                declare that exposure will come to every false prophet, to any self-seeking self-glorified human being
                working for self... Break down those walls in prayer, command that Spirit leave the Body of Christ.
                O Spirit of the living God, when you correct us, it is because you love your people, we praise you for
                bringing correction and proper alignment to your beloved.<br /><br />

                Oh, that You would rend the heavens! That You would come down! That the mountains might shake at Your
                presence— As fire burns brushwood, as fire causes water to boil— To make Your name known to Your
                adversaries, That the nations may tremble at Your presence!
                When You did awesome things for which we did not look, you came down,
                The mountains shook at Your presence.
                For since the beginning of the world Men have not heard nor perceived by the ear, nor has the eye seen
                any God besides You, who acts for the one who waits for Him.
                Isaiah 55:8-12 The spheres of influence in Media and Music
                “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,” says the Lord. “For as the heavens
                are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts.
                “For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and do not return there, but water the earth, and
                make it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
                So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, but it shall
                accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.
                “For you shall go out with joy and be led out with peace; The mountains and the hills Shall break forth
                into singing before you, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.<br /><br />

                We reverence You o Lord, we declare that this will be a day counted and written in the scrolls of
                heaven, that everything that has breath will praise the Lord, the mountains shall break forth in praise,
                the trees shall clap its hands... Music will be given back and be used for its intended purpose.

                “Behold, I will make you into a new threshing sledge with sharp teeth.
                You shall thresh the mountains and beat them small and make the hills like chaff.
                You shall winnow them, the wind shall carry them away, And the whirlwind shall scatter them; You shall
                rejoice in the Lord, And glory in the Holy One of Israel.<br /><br />
