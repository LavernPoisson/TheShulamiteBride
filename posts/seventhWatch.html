                Pray always in the Spirit.<br /><br />

                Number 7 biblical number represents completion and a time to rest...<br />
                The heavens and the earth were completed 7 days.
                The number 7 is associated with perfection, wholeness, financial blessings, and rest.<br /><br />

                Prayer Decrees for this watch: (Personal Decrees)<br /><br />

                I have peace with God through Your Son, Jesus Christ. Therefore, I can enter into the rest He has
                provided for me.
                God has called me to testify of Jesus Christ to those whom the Holy Spirit leads me.
                God is above all gods. He alone is my refuge and place of safety.
                The Lord is my God, and I trust Him.
                I go to God for safety, and He protects me. He alone is my refuge and place of safety; He is my God, and
                I am trusting in Him.
                God rescues me from every trap and protects me from deadly diseases. He shields me with His wings!
                They shelter me.
                His faithful promises are my armor. Therefore, no evil will befall me, and no disaster will come to my
                home.
                God has put His angels to watch over me wherever I go.
                Therefore, I will not hit my foot on a rock.<br /><br />

                I have no lack, there is no poverty in my family, my body suffers no sickness, nor is there drought in
                my finances.
                You supply all my needs according to Your glorious riches in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:19).
                Give God the praise and honor for all He has done....<br /><br />

                (Prayer Decrees for families, friends, loved ones)<br /><br />

                A time to remember others in prayer, a time to intercede on their behalf that the perfect will of God
                for their lives will manifest, that they will also find rest.<br /><br />

                Joshua 1:13-15 NIV‬<br />
                “Remember the command that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you after he said, ‘The Lord your God will
                give you rest by giving you this land.’<br /><br />

                Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the
                Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites.
                You are to help them until the Lord gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have
                taken possession of the land the Lord your God is giving them.
                After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east
                of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”<br /><br />

                We lift up our families, neighbors, and loved ones in prayer this day...
                we pray that their hands are learning to train for war. They are being strengthened to take possession
                of their lands
                We pray that the wisdom of God falls fresh upon our loved ones cause them to walk in the abundance of
                rain, we loosed them from debt,
                Pray for debt cancelation....
                Freedom in finances to advance the Kingdom of God and to be a help to others.
                Pray for kingdom financiers, for provisions to be made available.<br /><br />

                Thank you, Lord, for giving us rest,
                Declare our loved ones are healthy, wealthy, provisions are made, and we thank you for every blessing
                that is found in you, we know your blessings are eternal and forever more and we thank full for answered
                prayers.<br /><br />

                Exodus 23:10-11
                Six years you shall sow your land and gather in its produce, but the seventh year you shall let it rest
                and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave, the beasts of the field may
                eat. In like manner, you shall do with your vineyard and your olive grove.<br /><br />

                Thank you, Lord, for raising up your children in this time....
                There will be plenty left over for others...
                Thank you for abundance...
                We say thank you, Lord, for supplying all of our needs, pressed down, shaken together, and running over
                that the abundance rain has rested over the lands of your people...
                Enlighten your people o Lord that have faith to produce wealth to teach and impart with others that
                don't have, whose faith is smaller in the area of finances....<br /><br />

                Many have sown into their lands for many years but have not received a harvest and break through and
                have not even tasted of its fruits...
                Declare that spirit of barrenness be broken,
                Declare that Spirit, which has caused delay, is broken
                Declare this is your land, this is your ground, Holy Ghost fire fall fresh upon us now...
                make these declarations as many times as you begin to take back the land that belongs to you
                Ecclesiastes 5:8 NKJV
                [8] If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent perversion of justice and righteousness in a
                province, do not marvel at the matter; for high official watches over high official, and higher
                officials are over them.<br /><br />

                We are the head and not the tail, we are above and not beneath,
                All authority has been given by Jesus our Messiah.
                So we stand in our God-given authority, commanding the violent perversion of justice to be loosed in the
                mighty name of Jesus
                We uproot the spirit of poverty, spirit of delay, spirit of denial, we draw the blood line poverty stops
                this day, we command the soil to give up its nourishment, we command the rain waters to wash over the
                soil producing vegetation, crops and fruits in season in Jesus Mighty Name.<br /><br />

                We do not marvel at the matter of the oppressed. We cry out on behalf of the oppressed, we make our
                petitions known...<br /><br />

                Watchman arise! Gate keepers arise! Speak life to every barren place
                speak life to every dried-up situation...<br /><br />

                Command dry bones begin to rise up...<br />
                Our declarations go forth mightily...<br /><br />

                The prayers of the righteous availed much the meek is strengthened ....<br />
                the lost finds hope....<br />
                the hurt finds healing....<br />
                the blind can now see....<br />
                the deaf can now hear....<br />
                the nations enter into Gods abundance and experience His rest....<br /><br />

                The Holy Spirit is partnering with the sound that comes from our prayers....<br /><br />

                South Africa will enter into rest
                We declare our country is coming out of debt.... For your Glory Lord,
                every prophetic word spoken over South Africa will bring forth its fruit in this season in Jesus Mighty
                Name...<br />
                the highest official "Yahweh" is in our midst,<br />
                Mighty Warrior, great in battle,<br />
                Mighty warrior King of Kings,<br />
                Lord of Lords,<br />
                Mighty Warrior ruler over heavens, ruler over the earth,<br />
                Mighty Warrior Lord of Hosts,<br />
                Mighty Warrior our God, we bring our nation before your throne,<br /><br />
