                Genesis 22:9-12 NKJV<br /><br />
                [9] Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed
                the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. [10] And Abraham
                stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. [11] But the Angel of the Lord called to him
                from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” So, he said, “Here I am.” [12] And He said, “Do not lay your
                hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now, I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld
                your son, your only son, from Me.”<br />
                I want to ask a few questions that I ask each of you this day to ponder upon and answer within your own
                heart, I'm asking us to self-reflect to see where we are at on this journey.<br /><br />

                Are we willing to make a sacrifice if God spoke today?<br />
                We all know that Isaac was Abraham's only child, what if the sacrifice costed you everything?<br />
                Are we all spiritually at a place to identify when we are being tested?<br />
                Do we have discernment to know if the angel stopped you that you would hear him?<br />
                "Abraham already had the knife over his son, it was a split second later when the angel stopped
                him."<br /><br />

                Sometimes God will test our hearts to see if we have the fear of Him, to see if we are willing to go all
                the way despite what it may look like or feel like... His always checking our hearts to see who can I
                send? Who can I trust? Who is willing to go despite what i may look like?<br /><br />

                If you have answered everything knowing that you are truly living a sacrificial life unto God in which
                ever area you see yourself, glory be to God.<br /><br />

                If there are areas that you could never let go of, I urge you to take it to God in prayer and ask the
                Holy Spirit to turn the stoney heart to flesh...
                Most of us are on this road a long time and in the length of our time many setbacks, hurts, expectations
                and so forth that have hindered our growth and became a stumbling block to move forward.... God wants to
                put us back on the right path but in order for divine healing we have to yield our hearts to Him once
                more.<br /><br />
